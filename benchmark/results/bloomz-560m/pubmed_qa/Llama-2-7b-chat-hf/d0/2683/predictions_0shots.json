Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) can cope with the new \"treating and testing\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the near future, as the region is already experiencing a significant increase in the incidence of ART-related adverse effects, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity is a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse, as evidenced by the lack of detectable norfentanyl in the majority of cases."}

{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is predictable in newborns, with false-positives being more likely to be admitted into well-baby nurseries, be delivered vaginally, and have severe hyperbilirubinemia compared to true-negatives."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of a combined or delayed strategy for liver resection of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (CLM) improves the results, as evidenced by a lower rate of mortality and a higher overall survival rate in patients who underwent global management compared to those who underwent local management."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) can be used to predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors, including pleomorphic adenomas, myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, salivary duct carcinomas, and Mucoepidermoid carcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the majority of UK radiologists (75%) are satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with a high proportion of departments (25%) providing reports on skeletal surveys for physical abuse."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, behavioral risk factors are believed to be responsible for the conversion from optimal blood pressure (BP) to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV was found to have higher self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample, with the latter showing a significant association with employment status and lower self-reported psychological symptom burden."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, with a median proximal migration of 0.83 mm and a median sagittal rotation of 1.3\u00b0 at 1 year postoperatively."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life.

Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care, particularly schizophrenia or bipolar disorder."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "No, open access endoscopy does not close the door to an adequately informed patient. The study found that patients from the open access endoscopy group were less likely to receive information and less likely to explain the procedure to the patient, and were more likely to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist than the referring physician. Additionally, the patients in the GI clinic group who underwent colonoscopy were more satisfied with their procedure, and the majority of patients, regardless of access, were more likely to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the volume change of uterine myomas during pregnancy is significant, with a mean decrease in volume of 35% and a mean increase in volume of 69%."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The association between birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood is confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects in early adulthood."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, double reading of barium enemas is necessary, as it improves the sensitivity of the first reading and the specificity of the combined reading."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications, as demonstrated by the successful recovery of all incisions in the study population."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "No, routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer surgery. The metastasis rate of the node was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations, and the metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes was not significantly correlated with the metastasis rate of the node. Additionally, the staging results of most patients would not be impaired, even if the node was not dissected, and the prognostic analysis showed that the metastasis status of the node had no significant influence on survival."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No significant change in antiepileptic drug prescription claims was detected during the FDA suicidality warning period, except for a significant increase in the number of AED prescription claims during the prewarning period."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records.

{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, peer review is a significant factor in the reliability of structured implicit chart review instruments for assessing quality of care for chronic conditions, particularly for COPD and a collection of acute conditions."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the failure rate of IUD insertions in community practice is under-recognized, with a higher failure rate in nulliparous women compared to parous women."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery are economically viable for head and neck reconstruction, as the additional cost of planning and guided surgery was reduced from US $5,098 to US $1,231.50 with a prebent plate and from US $6,980 to US $3,113.50 for a milled plate."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, there were no differences in risk factors for suicidal behavior by affective disorder polarity."}

{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC)."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance (MR) can substitute for conventional arthroscopy in the diagnosis of occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee, particularly in the detection of bone and cartilage damage."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease (MND) are an underrecognised association, with a significant proportion of patients showing impaired language function and major cognitive deficits."}

{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study found that lace plant leaves exhibited mitochondrial dynamics similar to those of non-PCD cells, indicating that mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation plays a significant role in PCD remodeling."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transurethral catheterization is the most common method of bladder drainage, but it is also a discomfort and increased risk of urinary tract infection."}

{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the HINT1 gene is a candidate gene for schizophrenia, as it was found to be differentially expressed between postmortem brains of schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls, and to be associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation.

{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The study found that patients in the MIXED group had a higher 1-year mortality rate compared to those in the other groups, and this difference was significant after adjusting for important clinical and demographic factors."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an intrauterine influence on obesity, as the strength of association between maternal and paternal BMI is similar for both parents, and the associations between high parental BMI and offspring BMI are also similar for both parents."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is marginally acceptable, with a mean FAC of 57 +/- 11% in the group that underwent TEE and 86.2% in the group that did not. However, the study also found that the transplantation was not possible in all hearts, with a failure rate of 2.8% in the group that underwent TEE and 86.2% in the group that did not."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a secret pleasure-lethal outcome that can lead to unintended death among children, preteens, and adolescents.

Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy is associated with damage to the kidney in women with more parities, as evidenced by higher GFR values in the group with more parities compared to the other two groups."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implant coating with antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity significantly affects where people with cancer die, with the highest rates of place of death occurring in the UK, followed by Europe, Asia, and Africa."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "No, women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary do not have Lynch syndrome."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection, as it was found to be associated with CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery."}

{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the surge capacity and injury severity distribution can be better predicted using hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualties incident data. The study found that the mean number of arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3, with a range of 4-56, median 16.5, and a high degree of variability in the distribution of injury severity scores. The study also found that the majority of casualties (79.2%) did not require immediate medical treatment, with a high degree of variability in the severity scores."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD) compared to nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). In PUD patients, the frequency of eradication therapy was significantly lower than in NUD patients, with only 34.7% of PUD patients receiving this treatment and 7.3% of NUD patients receiving it."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read, as demonstrated by the correlation between reading levels and components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, such as word reading and paragraph reading."}

The index of portal vein velocity (PVV) was found to be the most accurate parameter for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices, and the splenic index (SI) was found to be the most accurate parameter for predicting the presence of esophageal varices."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) in terms of acute phase reaction, as there was no significant difference in the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), or lactate between the two groups."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the frequency of skin care in critically ill patients is associated with the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) in the study. The intervention group received a protocol that was more frequent and effective in reducing the dermatitis score compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Yes, insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA) is clinically useful in improving the surgical approach and preventing complications, as shown in the study."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the validation of the 2009 TNM version in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma is needed. The study found that the new classification of primary tumors in kidney cancer was a powerful independent predictor of survival, with a significant improvement in survival after surgery. However, the substrateification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role in multivariable analysis."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures does not predict mortality, transfusion requirements, or non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic fractures."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parity increases insulin resistance during pregnancy, as evidenced by a significant increase in peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and a decrease in basal plasma C peptide/fasting plasma glucose (CP/FPG) in those with parity of 3 or higher, and a strong age dependence in the relationship between parity and insulin resistance."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant.
