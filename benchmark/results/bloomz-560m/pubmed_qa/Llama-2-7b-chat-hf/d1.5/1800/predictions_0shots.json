The implementation of the new policy will lead to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The implementation of the new policy will also lead to a worsening of the situation in SSA, as the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes, and overt diabetes is already high in SSA, and the implementation of the new recommendations will exacerbate the situation."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity is a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse."}

{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a single syndrome, which is characterized by functional somatic symptoms and a high frequency of psychiatric morbidity and hospital admissions."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT.

The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is predictable in newborns, with false-negatives being more likely to be admitted into well-baby nursery and have severe hyperbilirubinemia compared to true-negatives."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, global management at the same centre improves results, with a higher median delay between procedures and a lower mean number of procedures in the GM group compared to the SM group."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the use of diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) can be a useful tool for differentiating various types of primary parotid gland tumors. The study found that the use of epiDWI can be a useful tool for differentiating pleomorphic adenomas, myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas, but not Warthin tumors."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that UK radiologists are satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse. The study found that only 52% of departments had a dedicated paediatric radiologist, and only 25% had a dedicated pediatric radiologist. The majority of departments (25%) had a non-paediatric radiologist to report their skeletal surveys, and only 5% had a dedicated paediatric radiologist.

{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught, as the study found that participants in the study had high satisfaction scores with the course, and a growing sense of security in different communication settings after the course."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, peer review is a significant factor in the reliability of structured implicit chart review instruments for assessing the quality of care for chronic disease. The study found that the reliability of a single physician review was significantly higher for COPD and a collection of acute conditions compared to other conditions, and the reliability was higher for diabetes and hypertension."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the failure rate of IUD insertions in community practice is under-recognized, with a high rate of failure in nulliparous women."}

{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance (MR) can substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported.

{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is related to pylorus preservation, with a higher incidence in the group where the duodenojejunostomy antecolically was performed."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP)."}

{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the central venous pressure predicts fluid responsiveness in patients with heart failure. The study found that the correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18, indicating that the central venous pressure was a good predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients with heart failure."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, D-dimer can become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis. The study found that D-dimer levels were significantly lower in the histopathologic study groups compared to the other study groups, and the ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit was significantly higher in the histopathologic study groups."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes.
