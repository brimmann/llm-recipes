{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a poor prognosis after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer is associated with a higher risk of tumor progression and cancer-related death."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "Delayed phase imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis can result in significant radiation exposure, particularly for incidental findings. The study reports that the use of the delayed phase significantly increases effective radiation dose."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale is a significant predictor of cognitive impairments, specifically depression, in individuals with brain tumor."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B who discontinued treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs can be relapsed or have a sustained response to treatment. The rate of relapse is higher in patients with virologic relapse but the mean treatment duration is longer."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between the diameter of aortic aneurysms and their rupture rate. However, a trend towards a higher rupture of larger aneurysms was observed in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The SSC device can be used as a reasonable surrogate for measuring hot flashes, but it does not provide sufficient data to assess its acceptability by women. The study suggests that the device may interfere with daily activities and may not be suitable for all women."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prophylactic fixation is a cost-effective method to prevent a contralateral hip fracture, particularly in women younger than age 70 years. However, the success of prophylactic fixation is highly sensitive to the effectiveness and morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Residency selection criteria, specifically the number of clinical clerkship honors received, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, and Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, can predict objective and subjective measures of resident performance in orthopaedic surgery residency."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF is a better predictor than age and basal follicle stimulated hormone levels. However, it is important to note that the cancellation rate is increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle<or = 6."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The timing of feeding tube insertion does not appear to influence survival after the development of eating problems."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge with nurse home visits is associated with a higher rate of adequate specimen collection and a higher rate of repeat specimens when initial specimen is inadequate, leading to a higher rate of inadequate filter paper tests."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high-dose radiotherapy can improve overall survival in palliative lung cancer patients, particularly those with a good-fair overall condition. However, it does not necessarily improve survival in patients with a poor overall condition."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis in the elderly population. However, when the patients were divided into four subgroups, there was a significant difference in the presence of both values unelevated."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane does not significantly alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery. However, it can increase left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas and left-ventricular stroke work index."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Gluten intolerance in adult patients with celiac disease is a rare occurrence, occurring in approximately 20% of cases. The majority of patients continue to consume gluten-free diets, but a significant number may develop tolerance to gluten. The study identified three cases of tolerance to gluten, one of which was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that replacement milks prepared from powdered full cream milk and fresh full cream milk are not suitable for infants of HIV-infected mothers in the South African context, as they did not meet the nutritional requirements for vitamins A, E, C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine, and did not provide adequate intake of vitamin D. The preparation times for replacement milks were also longer than recommended."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Inhaled corticosteroids can reverse the effect of airway inflammation on the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients. The study suggests that ICSs can reverse the effect of airway inflammation on the perception of dyspnea, but the specific mechanism is not clear."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that older people with high financial assets were more likely to accept preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated when adjusted for invitational procedures."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women is not strong, with no significant correlations identified between ADT-G and sexual desire."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that comorbid major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence are associated with poorer outcomes of depression, including higher rates of adult depression and higher rates of adult depression compared to those in the absence of major depression or alcohol use disorder."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find any significant difference in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians are at a higher risk for carotid endarterectomy, as indicated by a higher prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis, associated risk factors, and longer hospital stays."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine synergistically suppress T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens in vitro, with similar suppression and synergy observed at lower concentrations."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Exercise training reduces heart rate and QT interval variability in both genders, independent of gender difference in heart rate."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a low base deficit on admission is associated with a poorer outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that infants with sun-induced urticaria had a higher risk of developing syncope during bathing. The findings suggest that the disease may be more common in infants with dermographism."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in significant increases in serum levels of beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA), which can impact the activity of peri-sinusoidal cells."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in self-reported sleep and energy problems can improve the accuracy of sleep disorders diagnosis and management in adult Japanese."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "Fluoroscopy is essential for the successful retrieval of lower ureteric stones, particularly those with calcified stricture, duplex system, narrow and tortuous meatus, and spontaneous passage. The use of ureteroscopy can help guide the patient through the procedure and ensure successful stone clearance."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between the occurrence and severity of heterotopic ossification following open reduction internal fixation of acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach and other patient factors, such as age, gender, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, presence of neurologic injury, Letournel fracture type, occurrence of hip dislocation, interval from injury to surgery, operative time, and estimated blood loss."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is a risky technique, with a high risk of complications, including spinal haematoma, meningitis, and epidural abscess. The use of ropivacain and norepinephrine before catheter removal can lead to thrombopenia and prothrombin time less than 60%."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that telemonitoring and teleconsultation can improve glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, but the impact on HbA1c levels is not significant."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in Sami-speaking municipalities were similar between the two ethnic groups. However, the recall rates were lower in the Sami population compared to the non-Sami population. The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the Sami was lower compared to the non-Sami population."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "The presence of ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure is associated with a lower risk of AF recurrence."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Serum pancreatic lipase can improve the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, but its use as a biomarker is limited due to its low sensitivity and specificity."}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy using a flexible endoscope is a feasible and technically feasible procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of intraperitoneal masses. The procedure can be performed under general anesthesia and is safe and effective."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant blood pressure difference between the arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome, with complete reversal and alternating flow being associated with the most severe cases."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation can be used to differentiate between minimally conscious state and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients, as it can unmask excitability/connectivity in some patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that both lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease. The importance of factors such as the patient's intentions, the severity of the disease, and the patient's desire to protect her husband's wife were the most significant factors influencing the acceptability of breaching confidentiality."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students in the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM) National Curriculum Task Force's recommended core curriculum for undergraduate Emergency Medicine (EM) education meet the national standards for clinical encounters of selected core conditions."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "The presence of bile duct sludge is associated with a higher risk of recurrent bile duct stones, but it does not significantly differ between patients with and without stones on ERCP."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the incidence of staple line leaks between the nasogastric decompression and no decompression groups. However, the longer hospital stay in the nasogastric decompression group was observed."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, with a high sensitivity for detecting nodal metastases and a low specificity for detecting hepatic metastases. However, it has a low therapeutic impact in some cases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a diagnosis of exclusion, as indicated by clinicians' belief in the Rome criteria alone, and their willingness to perform fewer tests, consume less money, and order more tests. However, experts are less likely to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion in IBS with diarrhea and less likely to make a positive diagnosis in IBS with constipation."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the correlation between radiographic transition zone and the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease is accurate, with a global agreement of 58.1%."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "The presence of the pyramidal tract sign on MRI and the duration of symptoms before surgery are associated with a poor neurological recovery in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the rate of progression from low-tone sudden deafness to Meniere's disease between patients with recurrent episodes and those with low-tone SD alone."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney disease in hypertensive patients. The DD genotype is linked to an increased risk, while the D allele is linked to a decreased risk."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a significant number of patients with age related macular degeneration who had experienced visual loss due to amblyopia had a stable improvement in visual acuity over a 12-month period."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the correlation of BCRABL-positive results from quantitative real-time PCR is strong, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9435 (p<0.00001). However, there are some discordant results, which can be explained by technical issues or sample preparation."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Spinal subdural hematomas following subarachnoid hemorrhage are rare but can occur and can be treated conservatively. The patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. The hematoma dissolved and had diminished completely 15 weeks later."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant differences in echocardiographic parameters between patients with and without LAA occlusion therapy. However, a larger left atrial (LA) diameter was detected during follow-up visits at 6 months and aortic root diameter was larger during follow-up visits at 12 months compared to the baseline dimension in pre-operation."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that untethering prior to scoliosis correction is not necessary for patients with myelomeningocele, as they did not experience neurological or shunt complications. However, it is important to note that untethering prior to surgery can result in worsening neurological function and wound complications."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Pulp chamber pulpotomy is a safe and effective treatment option for certain cases of irreversible pulpitis, but it is not a permanent solution. The patient may still experience pain and may require additional treatment for prosthetic reasons."}

{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention, with emotional prosody effects being additive at early processing stages and antagonistic at later processing stages."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pancreas retransplantation can be a viable alternative for diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease, with a significant improvement in both primary graft survival and second graft survival. However, it does not impact kidney graft function and survival."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, weekends are associated with lower quality care, including lower rates of intensive cardiac procedures, higher rates of adverse health outcomes, and delayed treatment."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "The presence of viral co-infection is associated with increased severity, higher clinical score, respiratory support requirement, longer hospital length of stay, and increased risk of pneumonia and mortality in children admitted with acute respiratory infections."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "Delayed appendectomy (ETA) is associated with increased risk of perforation and postoperative complications, particularly in patients with acute appendicitis. The study found that patients with ETA of 8-24 hours had significantly longer hospital stays and had higher complication rates. Age \u226555 years was the only predictor for perforation, while older age was associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between fetal gender and the risk of having an emergency department visit for asthma during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears.

The implementation of evidence-based measures, including bundles and checklists, led to a significant reduction in the rate to zero for>370 consecutive days in 2012."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, atropine does not appear to be necessary for ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures. However, it may be beneficial for those experiencing side effects during sedation."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation are equivalent concepts, with similarities in their underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services.

Factors such as lower levels of education, higher levels of anxiety, and fear of falling are associated with a higher likelihood of selecting the correct response."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is necessary for the detection of pneumothorax, particularly in cases with large pneumothorax. However, it is important to note that the presence of symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax can occur before the procedure."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Early surfactant administration is associated with a lower duration of ventilation, longer duration of CPAP, longer hospital stay, and less mortality in premature infants. However, it does not significantly impact the rates of chronic lung disease or mortality."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that those who were passive smokers during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave, including neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness, compared to those who were active smokers."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that 0.9 mm-thick double-oblique CT images can provide more accurate mandibular depiction compared to 0.3 mm-thick images."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Chemoradiation is a safe treatment option for mid and low rectal tumors, but it is associated with a lower overall survival rate compared to surgery alone. The study reports that 19.2% of patients with mid or low rectal tumors had local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months, and 17.9% had local recurrences after CRT plus surgery. The study also reports that local recurrence was more common in patients with lymph node metastases and perineural invasion."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the use of validated susceptibility SNP scores can improve the predictive ability of risk models in conjunction with clinical assessment, particularly for BRCA2 carriers."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that insulin 30/70 twice daily or bedtime isophane (NPH) insulin plus continued sulfonylurea and metformin can improve glycemic control in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care, as indicated by a decrease in weight gain, fewer hypoglycemic events, and increased satisfaction with treatment. However, the study also reports that patients in the IC group had less weight gain and reported fewer hypoglycemic events."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as it exhibits both high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy and a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when its D2 occupancy is exceeded."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine can impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, as evidenced by a decrease in uterine blood flow to 68 +/- 14% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma contributes to the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that episodic memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT can be a useful tool for differentiating Alzheimer's disease patients from healthy controls, but its diagnostic sensitivity is low."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Double-balloon enteroscopy is an effective method for diagnosing small bowel disorders, with a diagnostic yield of 75% and therapeutic yield of 63.6%. However, it is important to note that minor complications such as sore throat were observed in some cases."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Primary angioplasty is a more acceptable alternative to thrombolysis for patients with acute myocardial infarction, as it is a less invasive procedure and can be performed in a shorter time frame. However, it is important to note that patient satisfaction is higher at both intervention and control sites with primary angioplasty. The convenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites is lower in the thrombolysis-based care group."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation is correlated with the severity of injury, with a positive correlation with Glasgow Coma Score and a negative correlation with revised Trauma Score."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot results in unchanged right ventricular end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume, and ejection fraction. The optimal surgical timing for these patients is not clear."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy, but it is important to note that this is a retrospective study and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) in North Carolina has significantly improved the quality of mammography services."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of a broad-based electronic health information exchange (HIE) in emergency departments significantly reduces the number of repeat imaging tests, including computed tomography, ultrasound, and chest x-ray, in all 3 imaging modalities."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that gestational age misclassification may play a role in the observed difference in birthweight for Australian aborigines and whites."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma is clinically early cancer, as evidenced by a lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation, intrahepatic metastasis, and portal vein invasion. However, the presence of minute cancerous foci at the time of operation does not rule out the possibility of clinically early cancer."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages are a rare event, occurring in the night-time, but not in the day-time. The frequency of night-time haemorrhages is higher than that of day-time haemorrhages."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, black patients have a higher prevalence of underestimation of asthma severity compared to white patients."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laboratories reporting hCG results accurately report total beta hCG and total beta hCG as intact hCG. However, some laboratories may report incorrect results due to errors in reporting total beta hCG."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections is not significantly different between the two groups."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the conclusion that mesial temporal sclerosis is apoptotic. The findings from this study suggest that neuronal loss in mesial temporal sclerosis is not due to apoptosis but rather to neuronal death caused by recurrent seizures."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Golytely bowel preparation was associated with a higher adenoma detection rate compared to MiraLAX."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not predict a neoplastic nature, but older age and large size are significant predictors."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, in a family with atrial fibrillation, which is linked to hypertension and atrial dilation. The mutant channels showed increased current, leftward shift in voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortened atrial action potential duration."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The study presents a real-time PCR approach for the identification and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen using DNA extracted from pollen grains. The method was successfully applied to identify pollen taxa at the required classification level and quantify pollen grains in various test species."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10kg weight, with the Ambu SIB achieving targeted pressures in all three resuscitation models."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Menopausal transition does not significantly impact the quality of life in middle-aged women, except for the impact on the domains of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the incidence of confined placental mosaicism is lower in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared to spontaneous conceptions, but the difference is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, but it does not provide a definitive prediction of mortality. The APACHE II score may be influenced by other factors such as patient characteristics and treatment."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, perforation of the appendix is a significant risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The risk is higher than that of nonperforation."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of trabecular bone significantly influences the primary stability of miniscrews, as indicated by insertion torque, mini-implant mobility, pull-out strength, and correlation between these factors."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study identified that tuberculosis patients who missed at least one dose of drugs or one follow-up re-examination during the treatment course were more likely to be non-adherent to prescribed treatments. Factors such as observed by family members, monthly service expenses above 450 RMB, and supervised by phone calls were protective against non-adherence."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Induction chemotherapy can improve the outcomes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly those who have advanced stage disease and local failure. However, it does not appear to be the primary treatment option for all patients."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF and TGF-\u03b21, as well as increased expression of both VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 in stromal cells."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "The fragile esophageal mucosa, for which the term \"cr\u00eape-paper\" mucosa is introduced, is a symptom of primary eosinophilic esophagitis, which can be observed endoscopically and histologically."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a preoperative platelet count of \u2264 205/L is a significant independent prognostic factor for poorer 5-year survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that an underdescended testis is associated with increased postsurgical atrophy, which may impact testicular survival."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a shorter duration of psychological treatment for depression is associated with a higher risk of relapse into mental health care."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a written information sheet can improve recall of consent interviews for total hip arthroplasty by patients, as evidenced by a significant increase in correct answers."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in muscle strength and position sense between bicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty groups at 6 and 12 months after surgery. However, the bicompartmental group showed improvement in physical performance in the stair climbing test."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that T-cell deficiency does not significantly affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure in mice."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) is a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children. The study reports that endoscopic findings were normal in most cases, while histology was normal in a small percentage of cases."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this observational study suggest that high flow nasal cannulae are less noisy than bubble CPAP for preterm infants. However, the study did not find a significant difference in noise levels between the two types of devices."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "The clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth, specifically advanced cervical dilatation, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or preterm labor, is associated with a higher risk of recurrent preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease (PD) is endemic in India, with a reported prevalence of 71.4%. Common clinical manifestations include backache, headache, bone pain, and fracture. Other common bone lesions include skull and spine, pelvis, femur, tibia, ulna, and skull. The mean (+/-SD) serum alkaline phosphatase level at diagnosis is 1514 +/- 1168 IU/L and nine months after treatment with bisphosphonates decreases to 454 +/- 406 IU/L(P<0.03)."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans is not known, but it is likely due to obesity, with a higher prevalence in obese patients."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid after percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules is a safe and effective treatment option, with a high success rate and minimal side effects or complications. However, the procedure time is significantly longer in the aspiration group."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "The study found that increased disease activity, as measured by the BILAG index, and reduced physical function due to emotional limitations, as measured by the SLICC/ACR damage index, were associated with reduced health status in SLE patients."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the clinical outcomes between patients with ileal pouch and ileorectal anastomosis for intra-abdominal desmoid disease. However, patients with ileal pouch had a higher risk of complications, including bleeding, fistula, bowel obstruction, pain, and death."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Schizophrenia patients with exceptionally high pre-morbid intelligence have a distinct symptom profile compared to typical schizophrenia patients, with lower negative and disorganised symptoms, better global functioning, and insight. These patients also have higher levels of manic symptoms."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that betamethasone (BM) does not significantly reduce the cochlear toxicity of otic gentamicin (GM) when given together with benzalkonium chloride (10 mice) in the left ear. However, it does not prevent hearing loss in the treated ears."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "Fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms can be used to identify unexpected fetal anomalies, but it is not a reliable indicator of clinical outcomes. The study suggests that repeated sonography for fetal growth evaluation may yield a higher incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a genetic mutation in the BRAF gene may serve as a useful predictor for response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in radioiodine-refractory thyroid carcinomas, but the role of other molecular genetic alterations such as PI3KCA mutations and RAS mutations in the treatment of these tumors remains unclear."}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "The extent of lymphadenectomy can be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer, with a greater reduction in lymph node metastasis and a higher likelihood of clinical response in patients who undergo radical surgery with neoadjuvant chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a prior benign prostate biopsy is associated with improved biochemical disease-free survival in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that remote ischemic postconditioning may reduce myocardial damage in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, but it does not appear to protect against long-term cardiovascular mortality or heart failure."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that edaravone administration before ischemia/reperfusion injury attenuates ovarian damage, as indicated by reduced follicular degeneration, edema, caspase-3 expression, and oxidative stress markers."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasonography can be a useful tool in the evaluation of undescended testis in boys, particularly in cases of no palpable testis. However, it is important to note that it may miss other structures and may not be 100% accurate."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "Mammographic density, as measured by breast imaging-reporting and BI-RADS classification, is associated with a higher re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the re-excision rates between women with more dense breasts and those with less dense breasts. The study also found that the re-excision rates increased with DCIS and decreased with resection of additional margins."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty is an effective alternative to nasal packing, as it reduces the risk of septal hematoma, septal perforation, and postoperative adhesions. However, it is important to note that the study also reports a higher rate of minor oozing and bleeding in the first group."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound is a useful tool for detecting internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint, particularly in the presence of surrounding bone structures. However, its sensitivity is limited and some technical difficulties arise due to limited access. Magnetic resonance is a more reliable method for diagnosing internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and overall survival in advanced lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection between patients with recurrent gonococcal infection and those without."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn.

{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Elevated levels of certain cytokines, specifically IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6, have been identified in patients with epilepsy, suggesting a role in the development of the disease. However, the study also noted that there is a correlation between certain seizure syndromes and the presence of certain cytokines."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas, as shown by increased insulin secretion and inhibition of insulin secretion."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in length of follow-up, reoperation rates, or postoperative BMI/%EWL between patients with anterior or posterior suture placement for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. However, patients with posterior suture placement had a longer LOS and had a higher rate of band-related reoperation."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and a history of prior lobar or deep hemispheric hemorrhage should be anticoagulated, regardless of the risk of thromboembolic stroke."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, (18)F-FDG is a surrogate tracer for measuring tumor hypoxia, as it shows a similar uptake pattern to (14)C-EF3 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not provide evidence that treadmill training post stroke is associated with secondary benefits, such as improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus is a relatively common condition, accounting for 17.2% of cases, and is associated with neurological disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. However, the therapeutic effect of antimyoclonic treatment on the condition is not clear."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment significantly impacts the mortality and length of stay of severely injured adult trauma patients. The study identified problems in care delivery, such as technical errors, delay in decision making, and errors of judgement, at the level III trauma center."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa is already experiencing a significant increase in HIV transmission, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, due to the implementation of the new World Health Organization recommendations for ART initiation. The implementation of these recommendations will require a significant response plan, including measures to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity is a significant factor in the rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse, particularly in cases with high fentanyl concentrations."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant differences in pregnancy rates, live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates, or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rates between women with ovaries of polycystic morphology and those with PCOS. However, women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without other features of PCOS had a lower live birth rate and lower severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rates compared to those with PCOS."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS professionals can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask, but the pediatric BVM provides lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult BVM."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "A colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis is not a reliable indicator of the patient's long-term outcomes, as it is not a definitive diagnostic tool. However, it can help identify polyps and potentially guide the patient's management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas, as it can help identify contraindications and potential side effects."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising treatment option for type 2 diabetes, with promising outcomes and a low incidence of complications. However, it is not immune-suppressed or graft-rejection resistant, making it a potential target for metabolic surgery to improve or cure diabetes."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ESC (Electronic Stability Control) can significantly reduce the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control and improve the safety of drivers. However, behavioral adaptation to ESC may occur, and drivers may not fully understand the benefits of its inclusion in their vehicle's platform."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Yes, clinical supervision is perceived as effective by allied health professionals, contributing to clinical supervision effectiveness. The length of the sessions, number of sessions, and total period supervision are significant predictors of clinical supervision effectiveness."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain aspects of social exclusion, such as unemployment, income inequality, and poverty, can significantly influence suicide mortality. The influence of these dimensions on suicide rates is stronger than that of other dimensions."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound examination can aid in the assessment of the extent and invasion of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in the region of the glans, but it is not a definitive diagnostic tool. The study suggests that accurate measurement of maximum tumor thickness is necessary to differentiate between invasion into the corpus cavernosum and invasion into the corpus spongiosum."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "The study found that health care providers and patients had varying degrees of understanding of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers, with a significant number of patients having a poor understanding of the technique used with the inhaler. The respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable of the health care providers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the transverse apex of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis curves coincides with the coronal apex levels of the corresponding curves."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"treatment of early age mania (team)\" study did not find a significant difference in diagnostic characteristics between the phenotypic and clinical samples. However, it did find that subjects with a longer current episode duration, lower lifetime use of any mood stabilizer, and more severe symptoms of mania were more prevalent in the clinical sample."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is still consensus among country experts on the most important factors for providing accessible and effective health care services for immigrants in Europe. However, there is a significant difference in the importance of certain factors within and between countries."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) is present in cervical disk disease, as evidenced by its presence in the lavage fluid and its correlation with other inflammatory cytokines and pH."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, affect-regulated exercise training at an intensity that feels 'good' can lead to improved physical health, as indicated by a significant increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold and overall compliance."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both hepatitis G virus and TT virus are associated with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, with TT virus being more common in patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints are a significant predictor of subsequent symptoms of depression, but they do not have the same predictive power as income and age."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "The study identified early predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, including Sepsis syndrome, peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index values. These data can be used to predict outcome."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Inhibin, a new circulating marker of hydatidiform mole, is present in both serum and tissue, with higher concentrations in serum and lower concentrations in tissue. Its absence or low levels in the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles can lead to persistent trophoblastic disease."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that whole lesion time curve distribution analysis using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can provide valuable information for the diagnosis of malignant breast lesions, but its diagnostic accuracy is not as high as curve-type distribution percentage analysis. The study also suggests that CAD may not be the best choice for all types of mammography, but it can provide valuable information for specific types of mammography."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylaxis and dissemination are major reasons for not adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of liver hydatid cyst."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a significant number of women with major depression in pregnancy who did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. The prevalence of depression in this population was around 16%."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the manic and mixed episodes distinction in bipolar disorder patients is consistent over time."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that certain structural characteristics of a general practice, such as a large list size, training status, female GPs, and a low level of deprivation of the population, were associated with variations in the use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between 2001 and 2003."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurses can significantly outperform a simple objective score in predicting admission at triage, with a high accuracy and a low bias."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in vitamin D status between prepubertal children with celiac disease and prepubertal children without celiac disease. However, children with celiac disease had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than those without celiac disease. The season of vitamin D measurement was not a significant confounder."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the case report highlights the potential for severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine in patients with Crohn's disease."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, healthier lifestyles, specifically regular exercise, dietary changes, and regular blood pressure measurement, can lead to a lower utilization of healthcare resources."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a lower susceptibility to smoking adoption among middle school students."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "Yes, managed care programs can help low-income persons identify a usual source of care, but it does not have a significant effect on access to care for uninsured or Medicaid beneficiaries."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the use of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride as a pain reliever for post-operative adenotonsillectomy in pediatric patients."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study reports no significant differences in the incidence of recurrent mitral regurgitation or reoperation between patients who underwent minimally invasive video-assisted mitral valve repair with artificial chords and those who did not. The study also reports no deaths within 30 days."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the Medtronic Mosaic bioprosthesis has a lower effective orifice area compared to the Perimount bioprosthesis, but the difference is not significant. The use of larger labeled valves in the Perimount group may have resulted in a higher postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay seeking medical care for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction. Women delay longer than men, and women who are alone when symptoms begin, and women who received advice to seek help or call 911 upon symptom onset have shorter delays compared to women who were not advised to call 911. Men at home and outside the home have shorter delays compared to men who experienced their symptoms outside the home. Men with emergency room insurance and taking an ambulance to the hospital have shorter delay times than men who"}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a significant contributor to the development of recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis. Children with recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis and bronchiectasis have significantly lower alveolar macrophage phagocytic capacity compared to control subjects. Additionally, children with bronchiectasis have lower median efferocytosis and higher median IL-1\u03b2 levels compared to control subjects."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment can lead to significant improvements in tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a positive relationship between objectively measured relative aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure, with a higher workload being associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the hypothesis that secular growth acceleration occurs during fetal life."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that body mass index is not a significant predictor of prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age. However, a 10-point increase in body mass index is associated with a difference of 0.03 ng/ml (95% CI -0.40-0.49)."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes, including increased mortality, and higher mortality rates, particularly in young patients. The 30-day mortality rate is significantly higher in those aged under 70 years compared to those aged over 70 years. Improvement of care and the establishment of best practice are necessary to improve outcomes."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The case report suggests that a possible causative link between the syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis may be related to the presence of a mediastinal mass and cerebrospinal fluid cultures that are suggestive of tuberculosis."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the use of diffusion-weighted imaging as a reliable indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that patients do not like to be called by their first names by doctors, but they do like to be called by their doctor's first names."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ART patients face higher rates of elective and emergency C-sections during their stage of delivery compared to spontaneous conceptions. The study also suggests that all ART groups have enhanced risk of significant perinatal bleeding."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "Therapeutic anticoagulation is a safe treatment option for some patients with deep venous thrombosis, but it carries a risk of complications, including sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion, acute hemorrhage, and mortality. Factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unfractionated heparin use, and lower initial platelet count are associated with complications."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that British Army recruits have a significantly higher prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to Royal Navy and Royal Air Force recruits."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant attentional biases in episodic migraineurs towards headache-related visual stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Students with low clinical performance on preclerkship clinical performance examinations are at increased risk for failing a senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "The public's valuation of health care interventions is influenced by the context in which they are implemented, with interventions that are prioritized more highly being more valuable than those that are less valuable."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a dose reduction to one parotid gland can prevent xerostomia, but it is important to note that the study was conducted on patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers and the results may not be generalizable to all patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily should continue folic acid supplementation for a longer period of time. However, the study did not find a significant difference in treatment toxicity or efficacy between the two groups."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, laparoscopic fundectomy is a safe and effective option for patients with residual fundus/neofundus development following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for GERD symptoms. The study reports no mortality or intra-operative complications. However, a significant improvement in GERD symptoms was observed in the group undergoing fundectomy."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the visceral adipose tissue area can be used as a measure of visceral adipose tissue volume, with a strong correlation with visceral adipose tissue volume changes."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining is a useful tool for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 77.5%."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the position of the moon in the night sky influences the time of delivery, with a significant effect on multiparae and plurigravidae."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are cost-effective, with a net gain of 0.04 QALYs and a net cost of approximately \u00a3482/QALY. The incremental cost per quitter is approximately 17,562 euros (US$1716), compared to the standard look-up value of \u00a31390 per quitter. The life-time model results suggest uncertainty in the results, particularly regarding relapse after birth."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay ward at Westmead Hospital is a valuable addition to the emergency service, increasing hospital efficiency and reducing the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. The short stay ward accounted for a significant proportion of admissions, with a low rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed and a low rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with a stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward, resulting in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New"}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with Cushing's disease who achieve initial remission after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery have a higher likelihood of achieving long-term remission compared to those who fail treatment. However, the study also indicates that the presence of a tumour at surgery can increase the likelihood of failure or relapse. The study also suggests that hormonal replacement therapy may be necessary in some cases."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are associated with a single syndrome, with patients having more frequent visits to the GP, more psychiatric morbidity, and more frequent referrals to mental health workers and somatic specialists."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The decision making process in breast cancer management is influenced by the multidisciplinary team's recommendations, with some decisions being justifiable and others being considered 'unjustifiable'."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The study identified four (2%) out of 244 Staphylococcus aureus isolates that were PVL-positive and susceptible to oxacillin, but none were resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid. These isolates were located in different geographical regions and had different infection foci. The resistance to penicillin and fusidic acid was observed in one isolate."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dogs can positively modulate the behavior of children with autism spectrum disorder, leading to increased positive behaviors and decreased negative behaviors."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The insertion/deletion (ID) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with insulin resistance, as indicated by lower levels of specific insulin, increased insulin sensitivity, and lower levels of des 31,32 proinsulin."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between postictal psychotic episodes and the development of interictal psychotic episodes."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion can predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients, with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2%. The optimal cut-off value for predicting LVH is 60 ms."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the infection rate after surgery."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency medical services professionals believe that they should participate in disease prevention programs, with a significant proportion reporting providing prevention services during emergency calls. However, the majority of respondents do not provide prevention services during emergency calls."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the K/DOQI guidelines for vitamin D deficiency correction in CKD patients with hyperparathyroidism do not provide adequate doses of ergocalciferol for correction of vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a correlation between pain intensity and opioid response in cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that treatment as prevention strategies, such as the use of mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, may not be feasible in resource-limited settings, particularly in those with undetectable viral loads. However, the study also indicates that a significant number of patients experienced virologic failures, suggesting that treatment as prevention strategies may be feasible in resource-limited settings."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is not solely due to pyloric stenosis itself, but rather a result of pyloric mucosal redundancy."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that false-negatives in otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) tests can be predictable in newborns, with false-positive results being more likely to occur in mothers who attended antenatal care or delivered vaginally. However, false-negatives can also be observed in infants with false-positive results. Factors such as antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type can predict discordant outcomes."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that global management at the same centre can lead to improved outcomes for colorectal cancer patients with synchronous liver metastases, as evidenced by a lower number of liver resections, shorter delays between procedures, and a higher rate of disease-free survival."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) can differentiate various types of primary parotid gland tumors, with pleomorphic adenomas being the most consistent and myoepithelial adenomas being the exception."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant proportion of UK radiologists are not fully satisfied with their training and support received in suspected child abuse. The majority of departments do not have a dedicated paediatric radiologist, and only a small percentage of departments have a paediatric radiology opinion. The majority of radiologists do not have the expertise to provide expert evidence."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. The study also suggests that the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis have higher ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP compared to those without pancreatitis."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain lifestyle factors, specifically alcohol intake, may play a role in the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV is more likely to report higher self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample. However, the study also found that the recruitment setting (web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high self-reported physical symptom score. The only significant difference between the two samples was in the employment status of those recruited via the Web."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups can provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, but it is important to note that acetabular component migration can occur and the contact surface between the acetabular component and pelvis can vary significantly."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that octogenarian patients undergoing cardiac reoperations have a lower Barthel Index and New York Heart Association class compared to younger patients. However, the study did not find a significant difference in functional status or quality of life between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that open access endoscopy may not be an effective method for closing the door to an adequately informed patient, as it did not result in a significant reduction in preknowledge of procedures or test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer, or overall patient satisfaction."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the volume of uterine myomas increases during pregnancy, but their size decreases. The study found that between the first and the second study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that decreased in size was 55.1%, while between the second and the third study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that enlarged was 44.9%. The volume of uterine myomas that decreased in size was significantly smaller than that of those that increased in size."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The association between birth characteristics and intellectual performance in early adulthood is confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects in early adulthood."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading barium enemas can improve the accuracy of detecting polyps and carcinomas, but it can also result in potential alteration of clinical treatment. The study suggests that a second reader can improve the sensitivity and specificity of the first reading, but it also increases the number of positive results."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (VMPA) using vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA-VMPA) can improve access and decrease complications, as evidenced by successful healing of incisions and no cases of permanent weakness of the facial nerve."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes during primary lung cancer surgery may not significantly impact survival, but it may have a limited impact on the staging of patients."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant change in antiepileptic drug prescription claims following the FDA suicidality warning period."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study found that self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions were not as accurate as department of transportation records for the majority of stroke survivors."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients is a significant responsibility for physicians, and a 2-day course model based on experiences of the first three courses of this kind can help improve communication skills and increase sense of security."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that peer review is a reliable and reliable method for assessing the quality of care for chronic diseases, but its reliability is influenced by the individual reviewers' ability to distinguish between different types of care and not due to individual reviewer bias. The study also suggests that peer review is more reliable for conditions with a more developed evidence base."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the failure rate of intrauterine device (IUD) insertions in community practice is higher in nulliparous women compared to parous women. However, the study did not specifically mention parity. The findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Virtual planning and guided surgery is economically viable, reducing the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production by approximately US $47.50. However, it also results in a reduction in time saved, from 20 minutes to 11 minutes."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in risk factors for suicidal behavior by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites is associated with a significant number of acute side effects, including urticaria, which can occur within the first 6 hours after administration. These side effects are primarily due to the use of multiple vials of antivenin."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in left ventricular regional wall motion between patients with and without fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis. However, the New York Heart Association functional class improved to class I in 40% and class II in 43% of patients postoperatively."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, with peak levels of lidocaine being significantly higher at 250 \u00b5m (0.62 mg/L) compared to 500 \u00b5m (0.45 mg/L), 50 \u00b5m (0.48 mg/L), and 25 \u00b5m (0.3 mg/L). Additionally, peak levels of MEGX are significantly higher at 250 \u00b5m (0.048 mg/L) compared to 500 \u00b5m (0.018 mg/L), 50 \u00b5m (0.036 mg/L), and 25 \u00b5m (0.0144 mg/L)."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant number of practices do not fully understand the importance of temperature regulation for the safe storage of vaccines in the community."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that p53 alterations can serve as a predictor of tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiation in locally advanced rectal cancer, with a significant reduction in tumour size and local failure observed in patients with wild-type p53."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (HBO) can improve patient outcomes in necrotizing fasciitis (NF) by reducing the number of surgical debridements, hospitalization, and mortality rate. However, the benefits are not universally shared. The study suggests that HBO may be associated with a higher mortality rate and shorter hospitalization for survivors."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult European Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy patients can be treated with higher doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) due to its efficacy and safety. However, the tolerability of high doses of other antiepileptic drugs is not perfect."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant predictor of poor cancer-specific survival, metastasis-free survival, and disease-free survival in upper tract urinary carcinoma patients."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be a valuable tool for the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee, particularly in cases of meniscal damage, ligament damage, and stress injuries. However, it is important to note that MRI can miss some types of post-traumatic injuries, such as bone bruises and subchondral injuries, which may not be detected by conventional radiography or arthroscopy alone."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a significant number of patients with motor neuron disease who had impaired language function, but no significant difference in dementia or aphasia was found between demented and non-demented patients."}

Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the sensation returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting, but it is not immediately. The sensation is not completely recovered within a week."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders can impair the ability to convey emotional or symbolic representation of music, leading to atypical musical communication. The study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss had significantly lower recognition accuracy for emotional or symbolic representation of music compared to children with normal hearing."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that patients may not be entirely comfortable using colour to describe their osteoarthritis pain, with a majority of them choosing red for high-intensity pain and a range of colours for pain intensity changes. The choice of colours for pain intensity changes is influenced by the emotional meaning associated with the pain."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to rural cancer patients are safe, with no reported toxic effects. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the rate of febrile neutropenia, diarrhoea, vomiting, or transfer to Townsville for admission between rural and urban patients."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Surgery and radiation therapy significantly improve survival outcomes for patients with extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, with surgery being associated with improved survival for all stages and sizes. Age, gender, stage, and radiation therapy are independent predictors of survival."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant reduction in the incidence of delayed gastric emptying following pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy. However, the study did report a higher incidence of postoperative complications, including DGE, in patients with delayed gastric emptying."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with a higher prevalence of defecatory symptoms, including straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement, in women with pelvic organ prolapse."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence that c-kit plays a role in the growth and survival of uveal melanoma cells, as demonstrated by its strong expression and tyrosine phosphorylation, and its ability to maintain a high phosphorylation level in serum-deprived uveal melanoma cells. The findings suggest that c-kit may serve as a potential therapeutic target for uveal melanoma."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that telmisartan does not prevent hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes, but it does have a protective effect on the liver, as indicated by a decrease in TGF-beta immunoreactivity."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that some transplant centers may not consider transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease due to fear of harmful consequences."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Staging laparoscopy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is not routinely performed for patients with extensive disease or metastases, and the yield of the procedure is low. The study reports that 7.1% of patients with HCC underwent unnecessary exploratory laparotomy due to unresectability, while 17.1% of patients with cirrhosis or advanced disease did not undergo laparotomy due to disease progression detected on imaging after laparotomy. The study also reports that biopsy of the contralateral liver was necessary for 45 patients who underwent SL, leading to changes in management for 4 patients (17.1%) with cirrhosis."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ, contributing to improved risk assessment and treatment recommendations."}

{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The present meta-analysis did not find a significant correlation between central venous pressure and fluid responsiveness in healthy adults."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, D-dimer serum levels can serve as a diagnostic tool for acute appendicitis, but it is not a definitive diagnostic marker. The study did not find a statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups. The ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit was determined as 32.7% and 67.3%, and no statistically significant difference was found regarding d-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups (P>.05)."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death by modulating their mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Transurethral catheterisation is a relatively safe and effective method for bladder drainage, but it is associated with increased pain, discomfort, and increased risk of urinary tract infection. Female patients may experience more discomfort and symptoms of urinary tract infection."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Risk stratification using the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index score can be useful in predicting the risk of complications, ICU admission, and overall mortality in gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever. However, it is important to note that the MASCC score is not a definitive marker for neutropenic fever severity."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Halofantrine is not considered ototoxic, as it does not cause any significant hearing loss in humans. However, it can cause damage to the inner hair cells and spiral ganglia cells in the cochlea."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "The elderly with oropharyngeal carcinoma are not receiving aggressive treatment, but rather receiving less aggressive therapy, such as surgery, radiation, or combined therapy, compared to younger patients."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in opioid consumption between neonates undergoing thoracoscopic minimal access surgery and conventional esophageal atresia surgery.

{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, with a significant reduction in protein, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intakes compared to baseline."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with patella reduction position showing smaller lateral gaps and patella eversion showing smaller lateral gaps compared to patella reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA, which is a high-affinity inhibitory neurotransmitter and a component of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the hypothesis that the higher rates of depression in women are due to differential symptom reporting."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a delay in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer is associated with a poorer survival outcome. The hazard ratio for delayed treatment was 1.9 (95% CI 1.237, 2.987)."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that low birth weight and preterm birth are associated with increased levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a strong inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, which is inversely correlated with gestational age and birth weight."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence assays can improve the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive individuals by increasing the area under the curve (AUC) of C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, and the number of positive autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, past streptococcal infection is associated with an increased risk of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a rare histologic pattern of diffuse pulmonary disease, characterized by multiple lung nodules and a biopsy of a pulmonary lesion, which is characterized by a decrease in lung lesions and a lack of improvement with immunosuppressive therapy. The underlying immune dysregulation may be related to the presence of a fulminant hepatic failure."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant proportion of women who terminate their pregnancy within 24 hours of antenatal corticosteroid administration are still pregnant at 34 weeks or less. However, only a small proportion of those who terminate their pregnancy within 1 week of administration are still pregnant. The decision to terminate their pregnancy within 24 hours of administration is influenced by factors such as the delivery date, preterm rupture of membranes, twins, and before 28 weeks."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that fatigue in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is more common in patients with secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but the prevalence of fatigue in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is not significantly different from that in lupus patients."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter is a significant predictor of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in HINT1 expression between postmortem brain cDNAs from schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls. However, significant interactions were observed between sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the use of the combination of only voluntary anal contraction and the Sacral Sparing Scale (S4-5 LT and PP) for predicting independent ambulation in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury can improve the predictive value compared to the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with schizophrenia had significant decreases in whole brain volume, whole brain gray matter, frontal gray matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter volume, as well as larger increases in lateral ventricular volume over time."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively are associated with increased mortality after percutaneous coronary interventions. The study found that patients with normal fasting blood glucose levels had a significantly increased risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality compared to those with suspected or normal fasting blood glucose levels. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for the continuous variable was 0.65."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration. The plasma elimination rate is similar, the volume of distribution is similar, and the total clearance is similar. The plasma elimination rate is faster than the volume of distribution, and the total clearance is higher."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is a more aggressive disease, with a higher risk of developing advanced stage disease and poorer 5-year survival. The presence of negative resection margin, histology, and histologic vascular invasion are significant prognostic factors for poorer 5-year survival."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a significant number of gout patients do not fully understand their goal of achieving and maintaining a serum urate (SU) goal. The study found that a significant number of patients did not fully understand their goal, with a higher response rate for certain knowledge questions. However, the study did not find a significant association between gout-specific knowledge and self-reported health-related quality of life or gout-specific health status."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Government-funded, low-income vision care programs can improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals, particularly for those with financial difficulties. However, the study found that only a quarter of low-income individuals had access to adequate eye care services."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural residence is associated with poorer neonatal outcomes, including higher adjusted mortality, in premature births, even after adjusting for other factors such as maternal age, ethnicity, and previous premature births."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that intradialytic changes of ET-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of hemodialysis-induced hypotension and rebound hypertension. However, the study did not find a significant difference in pre-dialysis ET-1 levels between dialysis patients and healthy controls."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "The use of frozen sections during thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter does not significantly alter the outcome of the procedure. However, it is important to note that the sensitivity of frozen sections for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer is only 25%."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have specific healthcare needs, including financial-insurance information, communication with people with the same illness, and a better dialogue with clinicians, compared to younger cancer patients."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "Globulomaxillary cysts are not a distinct entity from other types of cystic lesions, but rather a subset of similar cases that are not considered for their own right. The findings from this study suggest that they may be related to the entrapment of epithelium between the nasal and maxillary processes, and that their clinical presentation may differ depending on the specific location of the cyst."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The study identified that fear of recurrence is closely related to illness-related anxiety and optimism, not to current symptoms, disease, or treatment-related factors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials have a significantly poorer prognosis compared to younger adults. However, they do not have the same number of symptoms as younger adults."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can lead to significant improvements in quality of life and sleep, as indicated by significant improvements in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) at the beginning and end of therapy. However, the study also noted that some patients had difficulty complying with CPAP for a variety of reasons, and some patients stopped"}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides income support to poor elderly individuals, can lead to a reduction in disability rates among those aged sixty-five and older. However, the effect is not significant for individuals receiving the maximum benefits. The study also found that the benefits do not significantly impact disability rates among individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefits changes."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study identified that pain relief at the end of range of all measured active movements, global loss of passive range of movement, and global loss of glenohumeral movements are significant clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. However, the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Cold preparation use in young children following the 2007 FDA warnings is still common, with a significant number of caregivers not using the correct dosing methods."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that vitamin C may have a protective effect against the development of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, particularly in those with early cast-related complaints. However, the study also suggests that the protective effect may be more pronounced in elderly women. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a higher tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with an increased risk for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough to diagnose clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome (ACS) in a significant proportion of cases. The study suggests that physician assessment alone may not be sufficient to identify all cases of ACS. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of physician assessment."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in the quality of mesorectum excision between colorectal trainees and consultants. However, there were seven local recurrences in patients operated by consultants (7.8%) compared to four in the trainee group (9.5%) and once again there was no statistical significance between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the school food policy at Dutch primary schools is not well developed, with a lack of clarity and support from parents, teachers, and principals. The implementation of the policy is influenced by the content, implementation, and support from parents, teachers, and principals. Parents and teachers perceive the school food policy as a responsibility, while parents and principals value the food policy and comply with its rules. Parents and teachers value the importance of food policy implementation and support."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is a result of eye-tracking abnormality, which may interact with the motion perception deficit."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer. However, it is important to note that the continence score does not differ significantly between patients with and without complications."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not provide evidence to support the conclusion that ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is associated with a deteriorating neurologic outcome after traumatic cervical cord injury. The findings suggest that the presence of OPLL does not significantly impact neurologic outcomes."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences are positively correlated with height, with a negative correlation between circumference and height in men and a positive correlation in women. However, the relationship between circumference and height is not linear."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Pain is a significant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a prevalence of 50%, a significant number of patients reporting pain, and a significant number of potential risk factors for pain. Depression is a significant risk factor for pain, while the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals is also a significant risk factor."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that older adults reported less dysfunctional coping strategies compared to younger adults, while personality traits, social supports, gender, and age were not significant predictors of coping strategies."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine laboratory markers, specifically the MCV, AST/ALT ratio, and sex, can aid in the differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the MCV, AST/ALT ratio, and age are independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "Immediate breast reconstruction does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, but it may increase the risk of complications and the need for return to surgery."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries, as the relationship between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage is not significant for breast cancer screening or cervical cancer screening."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the use of antibiotics as a primary method of pain control or reduction in hospital stay after tonsillectomy."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) in 17 psychiatric practices resulted in significant improvements in patient-rated depression severity, including changes in dosage of antidepressant medication, starting or increasing psychotherapy, switching or initiating antidepressants, and suicide risk assessment. However, the study also identified that one or more treatment changes occurred during 40% of these clinical contacts, leading to additional suicide risk assessment."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "The use of an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures is associated with a lower operative and radiological time, less pain, and less mobility. However, it does not significantly affect the clinical outcomes."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find that rheumatoid arthritis patients were physically able to participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and all-cause mortality is spatially heterogeneous, with a significant correlation in the West of Scotland and a lack of correlation in the rest of the country."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study identified several unique characteristics of effective therapists, including effective addressing patient avoidance, language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance. These characteristics were associated with improved outcomes in veterans with PTSD."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "The study found that depression diagnosis and antidepressant use differ between different geographical regions, with a greater prevalence of depression in Pakistani, Indian, African, and black Caribbean patients in the west and a reduced effect in black Caribbean patients in the east."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease, with knee extensor strength positively correlated with dynamic postural stability and negatively correlated with disease severity."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that preloading with colloids before starting neurosurgical patients in the seated position does not result in hemodynamic changes, as indicated by stable systolic and diastolic blood pressures and no significant changes in central venous pressure."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, functional independence, or mortality between men and women after intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke. However, male sex was related to a higher risk of mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary for the early infection rate of TIVADs placed without antibiotic prophylaxis. However, it is important to note that antibiotic therapy can occur during the procedure."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel to the socket of mandibular third molars can enhance the healing process, as evidenced by lower pain, swelling, and interincisal mouth opening."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant discrepancy between the patient and physician assessments of quality of life for lower urinary tract dysfunction patients. The physician underestimates the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on social limitations and emotions, while the patient overestimates it."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of metabolic syndrome is associated with increased heart dimensions, specifically left atrial diameter, in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Elevated plasma viscosity and starting treatment at a higher prednisolone dose are independent predictors of a shorter duration of steroid therapy in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that surgical resection is necessary in the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus, as it resulted in a higher disease-free survival and clinical toxicities in the surgical resection arm compared to the chemoradiotherapy arm."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that beta-endorphin deficiency during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving, but not depression or anxiety."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that increased use of private health care may lead to a reduction in NHS referral rates, but this effect is not significant after adjusting for deprivation and practice."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation patterns. However, the study did find that women with recurrent spontaneous abortion had a higher incidence of extreme skewing of X-inactivation compared to those without extreme skewing."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a lower proportion of hospice residents received regular treatment for daily pain compared to nonhospice residents, which may impact the management of pain at the end of life. However, the use of acetaminophen was the most frequently used analgesic for nonhospice residents."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that trainees in the academic vascular department have a significantly higher rate of preoperative assessment, involvement in the decision to operate, and complete in-hospital continuity of care compared to surgeons in the general hospital."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that oophorectomy may be necessary in some cases of ovarian torsion in children, particularly those with necrotic ovaries. However, the study also suggests that detorsion alone may not be sufficient to treat all cases, and ovarian cystectomy may be necessary in some cases."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is not sufficient for the accurate depiction of the abdominal aorta and its major branches, as indicated by lower signal-to-noise ratios and contrast-to-noise ratios."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the hypothesis that the number of reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals is increasing over time."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that pneumologists may be skeptical of the benefits of chemotherapy in treating advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, as it is an independent predictor of survival."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared to HMOs or primary care case management in the Medicaid program."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men, with a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 19.7%. However, it is important to note that the ADAM questionnaire does not definitively diagnose PADAM, as it can be used as a predictor of hypogonadism."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) can be an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor, with a positive predictive value of 67% and a false negative rate of acceleration VAS response of 29.9%. However, the predictive value of fetal acidosis is significantly higher for negative VAS responses."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of emergency ultrasound fellowships significantly enhances emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Obese children have a higher injury severity score, lower pediatric trauma score, heart rate, and respiratory rate, and a higher risk of rib fractures and pelvic injuries."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "The presence of an abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis is a contraindication to successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in patients with Crohn's disease."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year of radical prostatectomy is a predictor of poor treatment outcome in prostate cancer patients. The improvement in treatment outcome is more pronounced in patients undergoing surgery between the mid 1990s and the late 1990s."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that women without a history of major depression during midlife have a lower risk of developing major depression during midlife compared to those with a history of major depression. However, women without a history of major depression at baseline have a higher risk of developing recurrent major depression during midlife compared to those with a history of major depression. These findings suggest that there may be distinct risk factors for first-onset and recurrent major depression."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Early extubation is associated with a lower mortality rate, shorter intensive care unit stays, and shorter hospital stays in children undergoing congenital heart surgery. However, implementation of an early extubation strategy is associated with low rates of complications, short lengths of intensive care unit stay, and short hospital stays."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors, specifically occupational silica, solvent, and metal exposure, are associated with an increased risk of primary systemic vasculitis. Farming during working lifetime is also associated with an increased risk."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a flexible reamer system can provide adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, with significant differences in intra-osseous length between the 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 flexion groups. However, the study does not provide definitive evidence that the lateral structures of the knee are safe with this technique."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "The protraction of external beam radiotherapy treatment time is associated with a lower 10-year freedom from biochemical failure in men with prostate cancer. The NTDR, a measure of treatment duration, is a significant predictor of this outcome."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the preoperative diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis can be a reliable indicator of the site of infection, but single-valve replacement is not a safe option in patients with both mitral and aortic prostheses. The positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiography for the preoperative diagnosis of infection was 100%. However, the survival rate was only 85%, and relapses were not observed."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Acute hepatitis C in Israel is predominantly iatrogenic, with injecting drug use being the most common mode of transmission. The study identified a significant number of patients with acute hepatitis C who had spontaneous seroconversion."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Breast-feeding is associated with a lower rate of childhood illness, particularly gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and skin infections, in children with a family history of atopy."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve the detection rate of prostate cancer in enlarged prostates, particularly for those with smaller prostate volumes. However, it is important to note that the study also suggests that other factors such as age and prostate specific antigen may influence the detection rate."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of regional anesthesia in geriatric patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture results in lower morbidity, mortality, and health care costs compared to general anesthesia. However, the cost of hospitalization is higher in patients who undergo surgery for hip fracture."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that direct mesocolon invasion into the mesocolon is a significant predictor of poor survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer. However, the survival of the mesocolon invasion group after curative resection is better than that of patients with incurable factors."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that genetic mutations in LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1 can increase carotid intima-media thickness, but the relationship is not directly related to premature CHD."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D is a valid instrument for assessing the quality of life in patients with acute coronary syndrome, with a high correlation with MacNew subscales."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the pattern of outpatient care, specifically the use of cardiology and general medicine clinics, is associated with improved survival in patients with congestive heart failure."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that there is no significant intrauterine influence on obesity levels between maternal and paternal BMI levels in the offspring."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead heart donors can be marginally acceptable, but it is important to note that the study does not exclude suitable heart donors. The study also suggests that heart donors with a low ejection fraction and a high risk of hemorrhage, right ventricular dysfunction, or death should be considered for transplantation."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a secret pleasure that can lead to unintended death, particularly among young children and preteens. The syndrome is characterized by a personalized, ritualized, and symbolic biopsychosocial drama, which can be misinterpreted by inexperienced practitioners and can lead to a loss of gamble with death."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "STIR imaging is a more accurate and reliable method for the diagnosis of bone metastases at both 1.5 T and 3 T compared to T1w imaging, with superior results at 3 T. However, STIR imaging may have a lower sensitivity and image quality compared to T1w imaging at both field strengths."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) in the UK have varying degrees of agreement when assessing a seafarer's fitness, with Approved Doctors having a lower agreement than Medical Referees. Factors such as experience and knowledge of the MRs or their interpretation of the standards were the most frequent reasons for a change to fitness category or restrictions."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women with more parities had significantly higher glomerular hyperfiltration compared to women with no or one parity."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, implant coating with antibacterial-loaded hydrogel can reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. The hydrogel was able to effectively release all tested antibacterial compounds within less than 96 hours."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity significantly influences the place of death of cancer patients, with a greater number of deaths occurring in hospital and a decline in hospital deaths with an increase in home deaths. However, time consistent gaps remain. Hospice deaths are less likely for those born in Asia, Africa, and 'other' geographical regions. Home deaths are less likely for those born in the Caribbean."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have a higher likelihood of having a germline mutation in MSH2 or MLH1 compared to those with other cancers."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection, as it is associated with a higher prevalence of CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ambulatory process of care is associated with improved health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The new prediction equation for basal metabolic rate (BMR) in Chinese adults can be applied to a wide range of BMI, with an accuracy rate of 78.8% for a BMI greater than 23."}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that remote physician-examiners can be used to assess medical students' performance in objective structured clinical examinations, and the findings suggest that remote examination technology can be used to bridge the 'pedagogical gap' between on-site physician-examiners and remote examiners."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal and adverse neonatal composite outcomes, and a reduced gestational age at delivery."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in the risk of venous air embolism between head-down and head-up tilt positions during liver resection."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "The study found that glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified glassworkers were at a higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus compared to glassworkers, regardless of their occupation. The risk was higher for glassblowers and other foundry workers, and higher for glassblowers and other unspecified glassworkers."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current readiness guidelines for hospital preparedness for large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations do not accurately predict the severity of hospital injuries resulting from large-scale urban attacks. The findings suggest that a surge capacity and injury severity distribution can be better predicted based on ED discharges."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease, with a significant proportion receiving only a small proportion of the prescribed therapy."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that left-sided resection of the cerebral hemisphere can lead to impaired phonological processing, which may contribute to the development of reading difficulties in individuals with perinatal infarcts. However, the relationship between phonological processing and reading levels is not the same for both right and left hemispheres."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eliminating \"missed opportunities\" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings can lead to a significant reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "The non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis using duplex Doppler ultrasonography is feasible, with a cut-off value of splenic artery resistive index (SARI) at 5.0 being the most accurate parameter."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy, as evidenced by lower levels of inflammatory markers, lower levels of lactate, and lower levels of intraoperative bleeding. However, the difference in intraoperative bleeding is not significant."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the frequency of skin care protocol application can significantly impact the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients. The intervention group received a skin care protocol every 12 hours, while the control group received it as needed. The dermatitis score in the intervention group was significantly lower than in the control group."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control, as evidenced by a significant reduction in pain levels between the experimental and control groups."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Insulin resistance is a significant contributor to the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk, but it does not explain the association between fasting plasma glucose and cardiovascular risk."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia is a safe and effective method for preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment. However, it is important to note that it may not be the only choice for all cases."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The 2009 TNM version of the staging system for primary kidney cancer is a valuable tool for predicting survival, but it does not retain an independent predictive role in the multivariable analysis. The study identified significant heterogeneity in outcomes between different primary tumor stages, and the novel classification of primary tumors was a powerful predictor of survival. However, the study also identified significant limitations, including a retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and a small sample size. Further improvements are needed to improve the predictive value of the TNM staging system for primary kidney cancer."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system does not predict mortality, transfusion requirements, or non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. The ability of the system to predict mortality is limited."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parity increases insulin resistance during pregnancy, as indicated by a decrease in insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and a decrease in basal plasma C peptide/fasting plasma glucose (CP/FPG) in those with parity greater than 3."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cognitive function, specifically working memory, is a significant predictor of frequency-compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism in the ADRB2 gene is associated with an increased risk for transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), as indicated by a higher risk for TTN in beta1Ser49 homozygotes. The T-47C, A46G, C79G, C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene is also associated with TTN."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this pilot study do not support the conclusion that a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improves bariatric surgery outcomes."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find that aortic balloon predilatation is necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in recanalization rates, time to thrombolysis, or clinical outcomes between men and women in acute stroke patients receiving intravenous rt-PA treatment."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, as it is a reliable and relatively inexpensive method for detecting EGFR mutations. The correlation between the mutations detected in serum and tumor samples is high, and the response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors is significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of Web-based systems for standardizing care in medical oncology is a significant factor influencing the uptake and use of the system. The study identified clinician-specific factors, such as autonomy and lack of time, as important considerations. The level of education received regarding the system was also found to be crucial."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, being small for gestational age is a significant risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity, particularly in the first six weeks of life."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "Fast food consumption is associated with an increased risk of asthma, as indicated by a higher prevalence of wheeze and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, but no effect on atopy."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass is an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia in patients with critical leg ischemia and insufficient venous material. The cumulative primary patency was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years. The limb salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and at 3 years."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can detect mesopic pupil sizes over 6.0 mm, with good intraobserver and interobserver repeatability and acceptable interobserver concordance. However, it has a moderate sensitivity and specificity for detecting larger pupil sizes."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the TDP-43 type confers a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with type 1 showing frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased patient awareness and participation in clinical trials research is associated with improved patient satisfaction."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a significant number of common fall prevention strategies in patients who received inpatient rehabilitation, but did not assess the implementation of these strategies in the discharge documentation."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The expert consensus statement on follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices highlights the importance of an in-person follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks, 0 to 16 weeks, and 1 year after implantation. However, the number of visits is lower than previously reported, and the rate of follow-up is higher than previously reported."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CT attenuation values obtained with different scanners can result in significant differences in urinary stone compositions, and the identification of urinary stones using CT attenuation values alone may not be sufficient."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, are biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK for corneal haze after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery, but their long-term potential for corneal haze is limited due to the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that Internet access and use by young people in North Nottinghamshire is low, with a significant number not using a genitourinary medicine (GUM) website. However, a question line where students could e-mail questions to a health care professional was a useful tool for improving sexual health awareness."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound is a more accurate method for identifying fractures than X-ray in the diagnosis of pediatric fractures, but it is not statistically significant compared to X-ray."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, implant retention is associated with lower infection control rates and shorter treatment duration compared to two-stage revision surgery for infected TKA. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant difference in infection control rates or length of hospital stay between implant retention and two-stage revision surgery."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "Unmarried pregnant women in Poland have a higher risk for bacterial vaginosis, particularly Mycoplasma hominis, due to their younger age, poor economic situation, and excessive smoking during pregnancy. However, this association is only significant for married women."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concept mapping enhances the learning outcome of nursing students, as evidenced by higher cumulative test scores and a gradual increase in the mean scores of developed concept maps during the intervention period."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with an increased risk of hypertension in both women and men. The association was stronger in women than in men, but after adjusting for age, the association was no longer significant."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form can result in a significant cost-effectiveness improvement over a single free dose combination, but it does not significantly outperform free dose combination. However, the ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good.

The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine follow-up procedures, such as clinical visits, imaging, and cytologic examinations, can help identify asymptomatic recurrences and predict survival for endometrial cancer patients. However, symptomatic relapses can also occur and should be treated as such."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a lower infundibular height, as measured by the distance between the line passing through the lowest part of the calyx containing the calculus and the highest point of the lower lip of the renal pelvis, is a significant predictor of stone clearance after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "The mortality rate in the treatment of Fournier's gangrene is high, with a significant difference in leukocyte count between survivors and those who died. The mean hospital stay is about 19 days."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "The study identified two patients with a high risk of developing chronic progressive cervical myelopathy with HTLV-I infection, one of whom had a high risk of developing HAM/TSP due to the presence of high levels of anti-HTLV-I antibodies."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate."}

This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in pain intensity between patients who received local anesthesia and those who did not. However, there were significant differences in subjective pain perception between men and women."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis, length of hospital stay, or discomfort score between the ENBD and no-ENBD groups in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis. However, the procedure time was longer and the discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group."}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study identified a significant inheritance pattern for nasal polyposis, with a significant proportion of affected individuals having a personal history of NP."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "Emergency double-balloon enteroscopy and capsule endoscopy can be combined to improve the diagnostic yield and management of severe acute obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in patients with Dieulafoy's lesions and angioectasia. The study reports successful treatment of 21 of the 23 lesions and a reduction in the detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesion."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic antireflux surgery improves quality of life in patients whose gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is well controlled with medical therapy.

However, small effect sizes were reported in the post-assessment evaluation portion of the study."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence that estrogen and progesterone receptors are present in the tissues of the anal canal, specifically in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter, and that estrogen receptors are expressed in the perimuscular connective tissue of the internal sphincter of both females and males. The presence of estrogen receptors in the perimuscular connective tissue of males is more common than in females."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the overactive bladder symptom improvement between women with mixed incontinence who underwent midurethral sling repair and those who did not. However, women with a postoperative complication had lower improvements in the overactive bladder symptom."}
