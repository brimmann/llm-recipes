{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a lack of eligibility for an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol is a significant prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "Delayed phase imaging in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis can lead to increased radiation exposure, but it is not worth the additional cost of radiation and time."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale is significantly related to cognitive impairments, specifically depression and anxiety, in individuals with brain tumor."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B who have discontinued treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs can be considered for discontinuation treatment. However, the rate of virological relapse should be considered in the context of the overall treatment duration."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant correlation between the size of aneurysms and the rate of aortic aneurysm rupture."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The SSC device can be considered a reasonable surrogate for measuring hot flashes, with a concordance rate of 24.6% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. However, it is important to note that the device may interfere with daily activities and may not be suitable for all women."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prophylactic fixation of a contralateral hip fracture is a cost-effective method to prevent a contralateral hip fracture, with a relative risk of a contralateral fracture of approximately 30%. However, the success of prophylactic fixation is highly sensitive to the effectiveness and morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Residency selection criteria, specifically the number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, and number of publications, can significantly predict resident performance in orthopaedic surgery residency."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF is a better predictor than age and basal follicle stimulated hormone levels. However, the cancellation rate is also a significant predictor."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The timing of feeding tube insertion does not appear to influence survival after feeding tube insertion in residents with advanced cognitive impairment."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge with nurse home visits is associated with a higher rate of adequate specimen collection and a higher likelihood of adequate specimen collection within the first 9 days of life."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high-dose radiotherapy can lead to improved overall survival in palliative lung cancer patients. However, the difference in survival time between good-fair and poor overall conditions is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis in the elderly population. However, the study did find that patients with both values unelevated were more likely to have both values elevated."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane does not significantly alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease is a common occurrence, with approximately one-third of patients developing tolerance to gluten within 20 years of diagnosis. However, the study suggests that a significant number of patients may not respond to the gluten-free diet and may continue to consume gluten."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that replacement milks prepared from powdered full cream milk and fresh full cream milk are not appropriate for infants of HIV-infected mothers in the South African context, as they did not provide adequate amounts of vitamin D, folic acid, manganese, and iodine. The preparation times for replacement milks were significantly longer than recommended by WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids can reverse the effect of airway inflammation on the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that older people with high financial assets were more likely to accept preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated when adjusted for invitational procedures."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women is not clear, as there is no correlation between ADT-G and sexual desire in women."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that comorbid major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence are associated with poorer outcomes in adult depression."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find statistically significant differences in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians are at high risk for carotid endarterectomy, as evidenced by a higher rate of symptomatic carotid stenosis and a higher rate of neurologic complications."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine can synergistically suppress T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens, resulting in decreased T-cell viability and decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the present study found that exercise training led to a lower heart rate and a higher heart rate variability in both genders, independent of gender differences in basal heart rate."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a low base deficit on admission is a significant predictor of mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that infants with syncope during bathing in a pediatric setting had similar skin histamine levels to those of infants with aquagenic urticaria."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can lead to increased serum levels of beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase and hyaluronic acid in peri-sinusoidal cells."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in self-reported sleep and energy problems can lead to improved estimates of the prevalence of sleep-related problems in adults."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "Fluoroscopy is essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy, as it can help guide the ureteroscope into the ureteric cavity and dilate the ureteric meatus, leading to a more effective stone clearance."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "The presence of surrogates of injury severity, such as length of stay in the ICU, non-ICU LOS, and HO prophylaxis, is associated with an increased risk of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "The use of an epidural catheter before and after surgery for peritoneal carcinomatosis is associated with increased risk of spinal haematoma, meningitis, and epidural abscess. The use of a patient-controlled epidural analgesia before surgery is recommended to minimize the risk of these complications."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that telemonitoring and teleconsultation can lead to improved glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, but the impact on HbA1c levels is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in Sami speaking municipalities are influenced by ethnicity, with a lower rate of invasive screen detected cancer in the Sami population compared to the non-Sami population."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "The absence of ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure is associated with a higher risk of postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Serum pancreatic lipase has a higher diagnostic accuracy for acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase, but it is not a definitive biomarker. Further research is needed to confirm its clinical utility."}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy using a flexible endoscope is a feasible and technically feasible procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of various types of peritoneal diseases. The procedure was performed in a porcine model and was well-tolerated."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant blood pressure difference between the arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome, as indicated by a higher systolic blood pressure difference in the complete reversal and alternating flow waveforms."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) can be useful in differentiating minimally conscious state patients from those with residual conscious awareness."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "The study found that lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease, with lay people and psychologists finding it more acceptable than physicians."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that students in a 4(th)-year EM clerkship may not meet the national standards for clinical encounters of selected emergent conditions, as they did not receive all of the recommended conditions. However, the percentage of students who saw each condition varied, with a high percentage of students meeting the recommended conditions."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "The presence of bile duct sludge is associated with a higher risk of recurrence of common bile duct stones."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, nasogastric decompression does not appear to be a useful preventive measure for the occurrence of staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, with a high diagnostic accuracy for nodal metastases and a low specificity for other metastatic sites. However, it has a low therapeutic impact in some cases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, as clinicians are less likely to endorse it alone, and may perform fewer tests, consume more money, or perform more tests to diagnose IBS."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the correlation between radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and the length of aganglionosis in Hirschsprung's disease is accurate."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "The presence of the pyramidal tract sign on MRI is associated with a poor neurological recovery in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the progression from low-tone sudden deafness to Meniere's disease between patients with recurrent episodes and those with single episodes."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the ACE-1 gene polymorphism, specifically the DD genotype, is associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney disease in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the improvement in visual acuity in amblyopic eyes is permanent."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the correlation of BCRABL detection by quantitative real-time PCR results from homebrew assays is strong."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Spinal subdural hematoma following a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. The case report highlights the importance of prophylactic treatment and careful monitoring for neurologic deficits."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant difference in echocardiography or electrocardiogram parameters between patients with left atrial appendage LAA occlusion therapy and those without LAA occlusion therapy. However, a larger left atrial diameter was detected during follow-up visits at 6 months and aortic root diameter was larger at 12 months."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that untethering prior to scoliosis correction is not necessary for patients with myelomeningocele, as no significant neurological complications were reported in the perioperative period. However, the study also suggests that patients with myelomeningocele who had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction may still experience neurological complications."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pulp chamber pulpotomy is a potentially reversible treatment option for some patients with irreversible pulpitis. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a statistically significant difference in survival rates between patients who underwent pulp chamber pulpotomy and those who did not."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "Endovenous laser ablation in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins can lead to significant improvements in clinical and technical outcomes, including Venous Clinical Severity Scores, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire, patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates.

{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "Based on the available evidence, atropine is a safe and effective adjunct to ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures. However, the study did not find a significant difference in hypersalivation, side effect profile, parental/patient satisfaction, or procedural success rate between atropine and placebo."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation are equivalent concepts, with the same underlying factors."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, an advance care planning model can be feasible in community palliative care services, as evidenced by the implementation of the model and the successful integration of the model into their organizational structures."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies can migrate through the body towards the heart, leading to extra-lumen migration and potential complications such as bleeding, infection, and tumor growth."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant number of players and coaches do not believe that headgear can prevent concussion."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that early postoperative oral intake may be beneficial in some cases, but it is important to note that the study was not powered to determine if early postoperative oral intake was necessary. Further research is needed to determine if this benefit is clinically significant."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the failure of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is associated with steeper posterior tibial slopes."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that elderly patients may not accurately recall the response to a stroke call, particularly when presented with symptoms such as amaurosis fugax. Factors such as lower levels of education, higher levels of anxiety, and higher levels of fear may contribute to this inaccuracy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is necessary to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax, and to rule out false negatives."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Early surfactant administration is associated with a lower duration of ventilation, longer duration of CPAP, and longer hospital stay in preterm infants, but it does not significantly impact the rates of chronic lung disease or mortality."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that nurses aides who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave exceeding 14 days, and this risk was significantly higher than those who were not exposed to ETS at home during childhood."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the mandibular depiction of double-oblique CT images can be improved by changing the thickness of the double-oblique images. The highest value was observed in the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Chemoradiation is a safe treatment option for mid and low rectal tumors, but it is associated with a lower overall survival rate. The study suggests that local recurrence is common and that radical surgery is necessary in some cases."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the use of validated susceptibility SNP scores in conjunction with clinical assessment can improve the predictive ability of risk models in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that insulin in addition to unchanged oral hypoglycemic medication can lead to improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, as indicated by a higher HbA1c level and fewer treatment failures. However, the study did not find a significant difference in weight gain or hypoglycemic events between the insulin monotherapy and insulin in addition to unchanged oral hypoglycemic medication groups."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as it exhibits high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy and a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when its D2 occupancy is above 80%."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine can impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that enhanced neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is a crucial factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that using a memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease may increase the diagnostic sensitivity by a factor of 2."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that double-balloon enteroscopy is an effective method for the diagnosis of small bowel disorders, with a diagnostic yield of 75% and therapeutic yield of 63.6%. However, minor complications such as sore throat were observed in some cases."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis for a significant number of patients and carers, with high patient satisfaction and acceptable convenience of visiting sites. However, the study suggests that the added inconvenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites may impact patient and carer's acceptance of the service."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count is correlated positively with the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot is a challenging procedure, as the incidence of sudden cardiac death is high and the RV function is compromised. The optimal surgical timing for this patient population is still under investigation."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a low rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy following primary tympanoplasty, but it is important to note that the study was a retrospective review and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the mammography quality standards act has significantly impacted the quality of mammography in North Carolina. The percentage of facilities meeting the quality standards increased from the first inspection to the second inspection."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of health information exchange (HIE) in emergency departments (EDs) has been associated with reductions in repeat imaging, including CT, ultrasound, and chest x-ray, in all 3 common imaging modalities."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that gestational age misclassification plays a role in the observed difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the prognosis between well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and less differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on histological analysis. However, the presence of minute cancerous foci in the portal vein was observed in some cases."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage is a preferentially night-time event."}

{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly, with a high rate of errors in reporting total beta hCG and total beta hCG as intact hCG."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections is not significantly different between the two groups."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the conclusion that mesial temporal sclerosis is apoptotic. The study did not find evidence of DNA fragmentation or apoptotic changes in neuronal morphology."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that Golytely had a higher rate of adenoma detection compared to MiraLAX in average risk screening colonoscopy patients."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not predict a neoplastic nature, but older age and large size are associated with a higher risk of neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, in a family with familial atrial fibrillation, which is associated with hypertension and atrial dilation. The mutant channels showed increased current, altered channel kinetics, and shortened atrial action potential duration."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a real-time PCR approach for the identification and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa using DNA extracted from pollen grains. The method was able to accurately identify pollen taxa at the required classification level and accurately quantify pollen grains."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10kg weight, with the Ambu SIB achieving accurate delivery of targeted pressures in all three resuscitation models."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Menopausal transition does not significantly influence the quality of life in middle-aged women."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the incidence of confined placental mosaicism in IVF pregnancies is lower than in spontaneous conceptions, but the difference is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, as it shows a significant difference in mortality rates between survivors and patients who died. However, the predictive value of the APACHE II score for long-term outcomes is not strong."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, perforation of the appendix is a significant risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of trabecular bone in the bone blocks significantly influences the primary stability of miniscrews."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study identified factors that may influence the non-adherence of tuberculosis patients in China. Factors such as observed by family members, monthly service expenses above 450 RMB, and supervised by phone calls were protective against non-adherence."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Yes, induction chemotherapy can have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as it can improve the outcomes of patients with advanced stage disease and local failure. However, the overall survival rate is lower in patients who receive induction chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF and TGF-\u03b21, as well as increased expression of steroid receptors."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "The fragile esophageal mucosa is a common endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis, and is associated with dysphagia."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a preoperative platelet count of \u2264 205 is a significant prognostic factor for improved 5-year survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant association between age at orchiopexy and testicular survival. However, the odds of postsurgical atrophy were higher for testes located in the inguinal region."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a shorter duration of psychological treatment for depression is associated with a higher risk of return into treatment."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a written information sheet can improve recall of consent interviews for total hip arthroplasty patients, as indicated by a higher percentage of correct answers."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study do not support the conclusion that bicompartmental knee arthroplasty is more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that T-cell deficiency does not significantly affect spatial learning ability following toluene exposure in mice."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) is a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children. The study reports a high specificity (0.88) and sensitivity (0.73) for detecting VLEM in esophageal biopsies."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this observational study suggest that high flow nasal cannulae are not significantly noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants."}

The majority of cases are associated with backache, headache, and bone pain. Other common clinical manifestations include fracture, joint pain, deafness, gait ataxia, visual impairment, and difficulty in biting. The mean serum alkaline phosphatase level at diagnosis is 1514 +/- 1168 IU/L."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is 7%, but it is important to note that obesity is a common cause of misty mesentery."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid after percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules is a safe and effective method for treatment, with a high success rate and minimal side effects. However, the total procedure time was nearly double in the aspiration group compared to the nonaspiration group."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are significant associations between disease activity, disease damage, and health status in SLE patients."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the clinical outcomes between patients with an ileal pouch and those with an ileorectal anastomosis with regard to morbidity, stoma requirement, or risk of individual complications."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Schizophrenia patients with high intelligence have a distinct symptom profile compared to typical schizophrenia patients, with a lower prevalence of negative and disorganised symptoms and better global functioning and insight."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of betamethasone in combination with otic gentamicin can reduce the cochlear toxicity of the antibiotic."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms is not clinically useful for the follow-up of unanticipated fetal anomalies."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a BRAF mutation may be a useful prognostic factor for radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers, but the study also suggests that other molecular genetic alterations, such as PI3KCA mutations, may also play a role in the response to TKI treatment."}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the extent of lymphadenectomy can be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer, with a greater reduction in lymph node metastasis observed in the responsive group."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy.

{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasonography is a useful tool for the detection and evaluation of undescended testis in boys, but it is not a definitive method for the diagnosis of the condition. The study suggests that a combination of clinical examination and ultrasonography may provide a more accurate diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that mammographic density, as measured by BI-RADS classification and volumetric density, does not significantly impact the margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery. However, the study did find a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision in patients with denser breasts."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty is an effective alternative to nasal packing, as it reduces the risk of septal hematoma and perforation, and may lead to shorter operating times. However, the study also suggests that the study had a small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound remains a useful tool for the detection of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint, particularly in the presence of surrounding bone structures. However, its sensitivity is limited and some technical difficulties may arise due to limited access."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and overall survival in advanced lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population.

{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Elevated levels of certain cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6, have been identified in patients with epilepsy. However, the correlation between cytokine levels and epilepsy syndromes is not strong."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in reoperation rates or length of follow-up between patients with fewer or more sutures placed for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. However, the study did find that patients with fewer sutures had shorter OR time and longer LOS."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with both a history of intracerebral hemorrhage and a clear indication for anticoagulation should be anticoagulated, regardless of the location of the hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "(18)F-FDG is a surrogate tracer for measuring tumor hypoxia, as evidenced by a higher matching index (dice similarity index) between its (18)F-FDG distribution and that of (14)C-EF3."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that treadmill training can lead to significant improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation in individuals with chronic stroke recovery."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus is a common cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases, accounting for approximately 17.2% of cases. However, the underlying neurological disorders may also contribute to unsteadiness, such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and mild cognitive impairment. The study suggests that antimyoclonic treatment may not be effective in all cases."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a higher level of trauma center providing treatment significantly increases the risk of death and hospital length of stay for severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa is still in a critical phase of HIV transmission reduction, and the implementation of the new WHO recommendations for ART initiation and monitoring will significantly impact the natural history of HIV transmission and the development of cardiovascular, lipodystrophy, prediabetes, and overt diabetes. The region is already experiencing a high prevalence of these conditions, and the implementation of these recommendations will lead to a significant increase in the incidence and prevalence of these conditions."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity is a common finding in the medical community, particularly in illicit opioid abusers, who may not realize the increased fentanyl content of their illicit opioid purchase."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS.

{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pediatric-sized bag-valve-masks may not provide adequate volumes for providing positive pressure ventilation in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag. The study suggests that the pediatric BVM may not be the optimal choice for providing lung-protective ventilation, as it may not provide the same volumes as the adult-sized BVM."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "A colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis is a safe and effective method for detecting and managing polyps, but it is important to note that the presence of multiple polyps can lead to a higher risk of malignancy."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas, as it can help identify potential side effects and can help guide the treatment plan."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising treatment option for type 1 diabetes, as it offers significant improvements in metabolic function and shortened hospital stays compared to traditional pancreatic and islet transplantation."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of ESC in all vehicle platforms, including passenger vehicles, could potentially lead to behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC, which could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Yes, clinical supervision is perceived as effective by allied health professionals, contributing to the sustained delivery of professional services. The study identified three individual factors, namely 'receiving clinical supervision', 'having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor's' and 'having a completed clinical supervision agreement', that were significantly associated with higher clinical supervision effectiveness."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain aspects of social exclusion, such as economic/employment, and social welfare, can influence suicide mortality differently in males and females. The influence of social welfare is stronger in females compared to males."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound examination can be a useful addition to the clinical staging process in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, as it can accurately assess the extent and the invasion into the corpora."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "The study found that health care providers and patients had varying degrees of understanding of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. The study also suggests that respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable of the health care providers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the most rotated vertebra or disc levels (transverse apex) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are generally located at the coronal apex, but the most rotated vertebra or disc levels can also be located at the regional or global apex levels."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the treatment of early age mania (TEAM) sample is more representative of the child bipolar I disorder population than the phenotypic study, as it includes a larger number of subjects and had a longer current episode duration. However, the study also noted that some symptoms and ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality were more prevalent in the TEAM sample."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "The study identified 10 to 16 factors as the most important for each participating country, but there was a significant degree of discordance between countries. The study also identified a need for more consistent governance of health care services for immigrants in Europe."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) is present in cervical disk disease, as evidenced by its presence in the lavage fluid and its correlation with cytokines."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that affect-regulated exercise training at an intensity that feels 'good' can lead to improved physical health, as indicated by a significant increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold and overall compliance."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that both hepatitis G virus and TT virus are associated with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, with a higher prevalence of severe liver damage in subjects with hepatitis C virus liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of somatic complaints, specifically those related to insomnia, is a significant predictor of subsequent symptoms of depression 5 years later."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "The study identified Sepsis syndrome as a significant early respiratory predictor of mortality in children with malignant tumors and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis syndrome is associated with a higher risk of mortality."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Inhibin is a new circulating marker for hydatidiform mole, as it was present in high concentrations in serum and tissue samples from patients with the condition. Its absence from the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles suggests persistent trophoblastic disease."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that whole lesion time curve distribution analysis using CAD software can provide valuable information for the diagnosis of malignant lesions, but its diagnostic accuracy is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylaxis and dissemination are common reasons for not adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, and postpartum hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "Women with major depression in pregnancy are not identified in population health data, as they are not linked to a hospital admission dataset. The study suggests that the prevalence of depression in this population is around 16%."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients is consistent over time."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that general practice characteristics, including total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, and levels of deprivation, were associated with variations in the use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurses are better than a simple objective score in predicting admission at triage, as they outperform a simple visual analogue scale in both calibration and discrimination."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin D deficiency is a feature of pediatric celiac disease, as evidenced by a higher vitamin D level in prepubertal children with CD compared to normal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the case report of a 21-year-old female with Crohn's disease who developed severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine is not a new finding. Other reports of severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, healthier lifestyles, such as exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and drinking habits, can lead to less utilization of healthcare resources."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a lower susceptibility to smoking among middle school students."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "Yes, managed care programs can help low-income persons identify a usual source of care, particularly for uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries. However, the likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons is lower."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Topical ropivacaine hydrochloride does not significantly reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that artificial chords can be used in minimally invasive mitral valve repair with minimal risk of reoperation and recurrence. The study reports a low rate of reoperation and no cases of neochord rupture."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the Medtronic Mosaic bioprosthesis has a lower effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio compared to the Perimount bioprosthesis, but the difference was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction. Women who received advice to seek help or call 911 upon symptom onset had shorter delays compared to women who were not advised to call 911. Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced their symptoms outside the home, while men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than men without emergency room insurance, and men who took an ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than men who took other means of transportation. Men with emergency room insurance had shorter delays than men without emergency room insurance."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a forerunner to bronchiectasis, as evidenced by impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells and reduced neutrophil expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-1\u03b2."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment can lead to significant improvements in tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a positive relationship between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the hypothesis that secular growth acceleration occurs during fetal life."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that adjusting for body mass index may not significantly affect the relationship between prostate specific antigen and body mass index."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "The 30-day mortality and age-related 30-day mortality rates in emergency general surgery laparotomies are significantly higher than those in other surgical procedures. Improvement in care and education are essential to improve outcomes."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The case report suggests that a possible causative link between the syndrome and cerebral tuberculosis may exist, as the child had a history of recurrent infections and a tuberculin interdermal reaction."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in the development of vascularization between hypovascular and isointense hypodense lesions."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients do not like to be called by their first names by general practitioners."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ART patients face a higher risk of elective and emergency C-section rates during their stage of delivery compared to spontaneous conceptions."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "Therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is a safe procedure, with a low incidence of complications and a low rate of hemorrhage. However, the patient factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unfractionated heparin use, and lower initial platelet count may influence the risk of complications."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that new recruits to the British Armed Forces have a significantly higher prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource need compared to recruits from other Service areas."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence of selective attention towards headache-related visual stimuli in episodic migraineurs."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination. However, the predictive values for these scores are weaker than for the year 2 CPEs."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "The public's valuation of health care interventions is influenced by the context in which they are implemented, with interventions related to personal lifestyle choices and sports injuries being more highly valued."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that dose reduction to one parotid gland can prevent xerostomia, but the extent of the sparing is limited and the study did not find a significant difference in objective toxicity between patients receiving compensator-based IMRT and those receiving chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily may still need to continue folic acid supplements for at least 1 year. However, the incidence of neutropenia and lower disease activity were not of clinical significance."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, laparoscopic fundectomy is a safe and effective option for cases of residual fundus/neofundus development in patients with severe GERD symptoms. The study showed a significant improvement in GERD symptoms and a lower rate of complications."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a single level of visceral adipose tissue measurement can accurately reflect visceral adipose tissue volume and body weight changes."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining is a useful tool for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 14.8%. However, it is not a definitive diagnostic tool due to the presence of intestinal metaplasia in some cases."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of a full moon can influence the time of delivery, with a greater impact in multiparae and plurigravidae."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quitter of approximately 17,516 euros (US$17,160). The life-time model resulted in a net gain of 0.04 QALYs. The expected value of perfect information was estimated to be approximately 30 million euros (at a willingness to pay of \u00a330,000 QALY)."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay ward at Westmead Hospital was found to be effective in reducing the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge in children admitted to the hospital. However, the short stay ward was not associated with an increased rate of in-hospital bed use. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward, resulting in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that both failure and relapse after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease are more likely to occur in patients with a high likelihood of tumour identification."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome, but rather a group of symptoms that are associated with specific somatic syndromes."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The decision to accept or reject a multidisciplinary team decision is influenced by the patient's choice and the availability of additional information after the decision is made."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The study identified four (2.6%) Panton-Valentine leucocidin-positive Staphylococcus aureus isolates from bacteraemic patients in the UK. These isolates were resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid, but susceptible to all antibiotics tested."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dogs can positively modulate the behavior of children with autism spectrum disorder, leading to increased positive outcomes such as smiling and more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance, as indicated by lower levels of specific insulin and lower levels of des 31,32 proinsulin."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of postictal psychotic episodes II is predictive of interictal psychotic episodes."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion can predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients, with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2%. The optimal cut-off value for QTcD is 60 ms."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery can increase the postoperative infection rate."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency medical services professionals consider themselves to be a significant stakeholder in disease prevention programs, with a high proportion of them reporting providing prevention services during emergency calls."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients are not adequate for correction of vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism. The study found that only a quarter of patients achieved levels>or = 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) after 6 months of treatment with ergocalciferol."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a poor opioid response is associated with a higher intensity of pain."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that treatment as prevention strategies, such as the use of mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are feasible for a significant proportion of HIV-infected patients in resource-limited settings, but the study also indicates that the use of third-line ART regimens may increase the risk of virologic failure."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is not an isolated finding, but rather a component of the hypertrophied pyloric muscle layer."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes can be predictable in newborns, with false-negatives being more likely to be admitted into well-baby nurseries and more likely to be delivered vaginally. Infants with false-negatives are also more likely to be admitted into well-baby nurseries and have severe hyperbilirubinemia."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that global management at the same centre can lead to better outcomes for colorectal cancer patients with synchronous liver metastases, as evidenced by a lower number of liver procedures and a lower rate of chemotherapy prior to liver surgery. However, the study also suggests that the delay between liver resection and chemotherapy may impact the overall survival rates."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that epiDWI can be used to distinguish various types of primary parotid gland tumors, including pleomorphic adenomas, Warthin tumors, and myoepithelial adenomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant proportion of UK radiologists are not fully trained in suspected child abuse and do not have the necessary expertise to provide expert evidence."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 do not reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. Instead, they suggest that the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis have higher levels of certain cytokines, such as IL-6, compared to those without pancreatitis."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that alcohol intake, waist circumference, and HIV infection are significant risk factors for the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV is more likely to report higher self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample. However, the study also suggests that the recruitment setting (web-based vs clinic) may influence the severity of symptoms."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups may provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, but the study also indicates that the contact surface between the acetabular component and pelvis may vary widely."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians do not significantly improve functional status or quality of life compared to those in younger patients. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the length of hospital stay or in-hospital mortality between octogenarians and younger patients."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "The use of open access endoscopy is associated with a lower degree of preknowledge of procedures and test explanation, a lower level of patient medical complexity, and a higher level of patient satisfaction. However, the study did not find a difference in patient outcomes between patients referred from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic and those from a patient group referred for open access endoscopy."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "The volume of uterine myomas during pregnancy can significantly change, with a decrease in volume and an increase in volume. The study found that between the first and the second study periods, 55.1% of uterine myomas decreased in size, while 44.9% of uterine myomas enlarged. However, the percentage of myomas that became smaller and larger increased between the second and the third study periods."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The association between birth characteristics and intellectual performance in early adulthood is confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects in early adulthood."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas is a feasible and effective method for the detection of polyps and carcinomas, with a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of all lesions. However, the number of patients required for a second reading is relatively high."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (VMPA) using vascular-guided multilayer preauricular incisions can improve access and decrease complications, as evidenced by a 100% success rate in this study."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes during primary lung cancer surgery is not necessary, as the metastasis rate of these nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations. However, the metastasis status of these nodes does have a significant impact on survival."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant change in antiepileptic drug prescription claims following the FDA suicidality warning period."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors may not accurately reflect the extent to which they have been cared for by the Department of Transportation."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, resulted in high satisfaction scores and increased sense of security for participants."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The reliability of structured implicit chart review instruments for assessing the quality of care for chronic diseases is not as reliable as previously reported, and the study suggests that peer review may play a role in improving the reliability of the instrument."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the rate of successful IUD insertions in community practice is low, but the study also indicates that the use of specific interventions may help reduce the rate of unsuccessful insertions."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, using virtual planning and guided surgery for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps is economically viable, saving time and reducing additional costs."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is no significant difference in risk factors for suicidal behavior between bipolar and mixed affective disorder participants."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites is associated with a low incidence of acute side effects, including urticaria, which are generally mild and self-limiting."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in left ventricular regional wall motion between patients with fibrous tissue resection and those without fibrosis. However, the New York Heart Association functional class improved in 40% and class II in 43% of patients postoperatively."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, as evidenced by increased levels of lidocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) in serum."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the majority of practices in the community do not fully understand the proper storage conditions for vaccines, leading to a lack of adherence to Department of Health guidelines."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, p53 alterations can be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer, with a higher likelihood of response in the group with wild-type p53."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation therapy may be beneficial in reducing the mortality rate and morbidity in patients with necrotizing fasciitis, but the evidence is not conclusive. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical significance of the beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy for this condition."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high doses of zonisamide (ZNS) can be administered to adult European Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy patients, resulting in seizure reduction in approximately half of the cases. However, the safety and efficacy of high doses of other antiepileptic drugs should be considered."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker for upper tract urinary carcinoma, as it is associated with poorer cancer-specific survival, metastasis-free survival, and disease-free survival."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "MRI is a valuable tool for the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee, particularly in cases with limited joint movements and pain. MRI can identify bone and cartilage damage, and can provide valuable information on the mechanism of injury. However, it is important to note that MRI can also reveal other mechanisms of injury, such as meniscal damage, ligament damage, and stress injuries."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "The study found that a significant number of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) had impaired language function, suggesting a potential association between dementia and language deficits."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the sensation returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting, but it is not a permanent fix. The study found that the sensation gradually decreases after the procedure."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders that impair the transmission or decoding of structural features of music (e.g., pitch, timbre) and/or symbolic representation can result in atypical musical communication, which can negatively impact music therapy interventions."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients can use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain, but the choice of colours should be based on their own personal preferences and not on the need to communicate pain to healthcare professionals."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to rural cancer patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre are safe, with a low rate of febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea, and a low rate of vomiting and transfer to Townsville for admission."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery or radiation therapy significantly improve survival in patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy and pylorus preservation. However, the study did report a higher incidence of DGE in patients who underwent duodenojejunostomy."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with an increased risk of defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence that c-Kit plays a role in the growth and survival of uveal melanoma cells, as evidenced by its strong expression and tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. The inhibitory effects of STI571 on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation were of equal size and less than 2.5 microM."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that telmisartan does not prevent hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a significant number of U.S. transplant centers do not accept asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease for transplantation."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Staging laparoscopy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is not a routine procedure, but it can be useful in assessing fibrosis/cirrhosis and potentially guiding treatment decisions. The yield of laparotomy is low, and the accuracy is moderate."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ, as it can lead to a significant improvement in risk assessment and treatment recommendation."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vaginal pH can be measured from the wet mount slide with high accuracy, particularly in the normal or intermediate pH range."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that HIV-positive patients are at a higher risk of presenting with a variety of types of oral mucocele/ranulas, including simple and plunging ranulas."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The central venous pressure does not predict fluid responsiveness in adult patients. The correlation coefficient between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 in the ICU patients and 0.28 in the operating room patients."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, D-dimer levels do not appear to be a reliable diagnostic tool for acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death by forming mitochondrial permeability transition pores (PTP) and contributing to the remodelling process."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Transurethral catheterisation is a common method of bladder drainage, but it is associated with increased discomfort and increased risk of urinary tract infections. Female patients are more dissatisfied with transurethral catheterisation compared to male patients."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Risk stratification of gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever is useful, as it can help identify patients at higher risk for severe complications and ICU admission. However, it is important to note that the study was a retrospective chart review and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Halofantrine is not ototoxic, as no adverse reactions were observed in human studies."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the notion that elderly patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma are under-treated."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in opioid consumption between neonates undergoing thoracoscopic minimal access surgery or conventional surgery of esophageal atresia."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that clinical predictors for cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism are not adequate in the identification of cervical spine fractures."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "The study found that individuals with type 1 diabetes consumed a lower protein, fat, carbohydrate, and saturated fat intake compared to the general population. However, they still had a moderate intake of fiber and a high intake of saturated fat."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with patella eversion leading to smaller ligament gaps in knee extension and flexion positions compared to patella reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA, as evidenced by high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists and NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the hypothesis that gender differences in depression symptom reporting are accounted for by differential symptom reporting."}

{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by multiple lung nodules and a biopsy finding of all the signs of fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. The study suggests that the immune dysregulation may play a role in the development of the condition."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a higher proportion of women who received antenatal corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of delivery were still pregnant at 34 weeks or less. However, the majority of women delivered within 1 week of the administration of the corticosteroid."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that fatigue in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is more common in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome, but the difference in prevalence between the two groups is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter is a significant predictor of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the HINT1 gene may be a potential candidate for schizophrenia, as it was found to be associated with dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission in postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish its clinical significance."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The determination of acute phase sacral sparing measurements, specifically the use of the combination of only voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 light touch and pin prick sensory scores, can improve the prognostic value for 1-year independent ambulation in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, schizophrenia patients exhibit progressive brain changes, including greater decreases in whole brain volume, whole brain gray matter, frontal gray matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter volume, as well as larger increases in lateral ventricular volume."}

{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration. However, the plasma elimination rate is faster than the interstitial fluid elimination rate."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The presence of negative resection margin and histology of squamous cell carcinoma are significant prognostic factors for poorer 5-year survival in patients with stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a significant number of gout patients (14%) do not fully understand their goal of achieving and maintaining a serum urate (SU) goal. The study suggests that a significant number of patients do not fully understand their condition and may not be able to achieve their goal."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Government-funded, low-income vision care programs can improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals, particularly for those with financial difficulties.

{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that rural residence is associated with a higher risk of neonatal outcomes, including longer term outcomes, such as prolonged ruptured membranes, and a higher stillbirth rate, in premature infants born to mothers residing in rural areas."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the present study provides evidence that intradialytic changes of ET-1 play a role in the pathogenesis of hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "The use of frozen section analysis during thyroid surgery for multinodular thyroid disease is not a reliable method for determining the outcome of the procedure."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared to younger cancer patients, specifically in financial-insurance information, communication with other patients, and a better dialogue with clinicians."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "Globulomaxillary cysts are not considered for their own right as they do not have a definitive entity. However, they are still common in daily practice and should be considered as entities within the same field of medicine."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fear of recurrence is directly related to pre-treatment optimism and optimism about cancer treatment outcomes."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials have a poorer prognosis compared to younger adults. However, older adults with more symptoms have a higher risk of complications and greater decline in functional status."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CPAP therapy can lead to significant improvements in sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with obstructive sleep apnea, but the study also noted some difficulties in initiating and accepting CPAP therapy."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides financial assistance to poor elderly individuals, may have a positive impact on disability rates in the elderly population, but the findings are not consistent across all measures and may not be the primary determinant of population health."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study identified pain at the end of range of all measured active movements as a clinical identifier for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, but the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that concerns still exist regarding the use and delivery of cough and cold medicines in young children, particularly in areas where the warning period for these medicines was earlier."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that vitamin C may have a protective effect against the development of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, but the effect was not statistically significant in the dose-response study. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a higher tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with an increased risk for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough to reliably identify clinically unsuspected cases of acute chest syndrome (ACS). The study found that a high percentage of ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the physician before obtaining CXR results. The diagnostic accuracy for predicting ACS was only 39%, and the overall physician sensitivity for predicting ACS was only 37%."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in the quality of mesorectal excision between colorectal trainees and consultants. However, there were seven local recurrences in patients operated by consultants."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the school food policy at Dutch primary schools is relatively well developed, with a high level of implementation and support from parents and teachers. However, the implementation of the policy is still a challenge for both principals and teachers, with a high degree of variation in the parents' perception of the policy."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that motion perception deficits in schizophrenia patients are a result of eye-tracking abnormality, which may interact with the motion perception deficits."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between the presence of ossified posterior longitudinal ligament and neurologic outcomes in patients with traumatic cervical cord injury."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences are associated with height, with a negative scaling of body circumference to height in both men and women."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a prevalence of 50% and a significant association with specific psychiatric diagnoses. Depression is a significant risk factor for pain."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, age moderates the relationship between personality disorder and coping strategies in psychiatric inpatients. Older adults report less dysfunctional coping strategies compared to younger adults."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant association between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine laboratory markers, specifically the Liver Function Test (LFT) and the AST/ALT ratio, can help distinguish nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). The MCV, AST/ALT ratio, and sex are significant predictors of high-grade fibrosis."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in complications between immediate breast reconstruction and mastectomy alone in terms of breast cancer patient outcomes."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to the coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries, as the relationship between overall coverage and economic inequalities in screening participation is not significant."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the use of antibiotics as a primary method of post-tonsillectomy pain control."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitors, such as the Sequenced Treatments Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), can be a useful and feasible approach for improving clinical decision-making in psychiatric practices. However, the study also indicates that the implementation of PHQ-9 in these practices was not a straightforward process, with a high rate of treatment changes and additional suicide risk assessment."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not provide evidence to suggest that an intramedullary nail is more effective than a sliding compression hip screw in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find statistically significant differences in physical ability between rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and all-cause mortality is significantly different from that between deprivation and mortality in the West."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a moderate level of variability in the implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in veterans' posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinics, with a high proportion of variability due to therapists. These therapists demonstrate effective skills in addressing patient avoidance, language use in supervision, and developing a strong therapeutic alliance."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "The study found that depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing varies by location, with Indian patients having a lower odds of diagnosis compared to Pakistani, Indian, African, and Bangladeshi patients. Black Caribbean patients showed a similar effect."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation are related in patients with Parkinson's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preloading with colloids before starting neurosurgical patients on general anesthesia can prevent hemodynamic changes during seated positioning."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a sex difference in the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke, but male sex was related to a higher risk of mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary for patients who have undergone TIVAD placement without antibiotic prophylaxis. However, the study did identify one patient who received an antibiotic the day of implantation and developed a CLABSI."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel significantly enhances the healing potential and reduces pain, swelling, and interincisal mouth opening in patients undergoing mandibular third molar extraction."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between the quality of life assessment by both patients and physicians, with a higher percentage of underestimation of impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on social limitations and emotions."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of metabolic syndrome is associated with increased heart dimensions in hypertensive patients, as indicated by increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, and left ventricular mass."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "The presence of elevated plasma viscosity and starting treatment at a higher prednisolone dose are independent predictors of a shorter duration of steroid therapy in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that surgical resection is necessary in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus who have achieved radiological complete response to chemoradiotherapy."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that beta-endorphin deficiency during alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, but the relationship is not strong and may be influenced by other factors."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of private health care for health care is increasing, but the relationship between the two is not clear-cut. The study found that patients from the most deprived fifth of wards had higher private referral rates compared to patients in the least deprived fifth of wards, but the difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for deprivation and practice."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that hospice residents received more regular analgesic treatment for daily pain compared to nonhospice residents at the end of life."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that residents in the academic vascular department had a significantly higher rate of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate compared to same-day admission patients."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that oophorectomy is a safe and effective option for children with ovarian torsion, with a lower rate of complications and shorter hospital stays compared to detorsion. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger patient populations."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is not a reliable method for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis, as it shows lower signal-to-noise ratios and contrast-to-noise ratios compared to single-dose angiography."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the hypothesis that the number of reported unsafe sexual behaviors among HIV-infected individuals is increasing over time."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that pneumologists' skepticism towards chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma is justified, as the study found that patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1 had a better prognosis compared to those with ECOG scores of 1 to 2."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs.

{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire is a useful tool for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men, with a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PADAM. However, it is important to note that the ADAM questionnaire may not be the definitive diagnostic tool for PADAM. Other factors such as testosterone levels and SHBG levels may also play a role in the diagnosis of PADAM."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor, with a high positive predictive value (PPV) and a low false negative rate."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of emergency ultrasound fellowships significantly enhances emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children.

This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year of radical prostatectomy is a predictor of improved patient outcomes after prostatectomy."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women without a prior major depression history had a lower risk of developing major depression during midlife compared to those with a prior major depression history. However, the risk profiles differed between women with and without a history of major depression. Factors such as psychological symptoms and a prior anxiety disorder were more common in women without a history of major depression."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Early extubation is a feasible and effective strategy for all children undergoing congenital heart surgery, including neonates, and is associated with a lower rate of complications and shorter intensive care unit stays. However, the implementation of an early extubation strategy is associated with a lower rate of complications and shorter hospital stays."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Environmental factors, such as occupational exposure to silica, solvent, and metal, are associated with an increased risk of primary systemic vasculitis. Farming during working lifetime is also associated with an increased risk."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the use of a flexible reamer system at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths, but the distance to the common peroneal nerve and femoral attachment of the lateral ligament is longer at higher flexions."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "The protraction of radiotherapy time is associated with a higher risk of biochemical failure and a lower freedom from biochemical failure in prostate cancer patients. The NTDR, a measure of treatment duration, is a significant predictor of both outcomes."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement is a safe option for patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis, but the diagnosis of the infection site is crucial for the safety of the procedure. The study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be a useful tool for the preoperative diagnosis of the infection site, but it is not the only method. Other diagnostic methods, such as biopsy, culture, and immunohistochemistry, can also be used."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Acute hepatitis C in Israel is predominantly iatrogenic, with injecting drug use being the most common transmission route. Spontaneous seroconversion has occurred in approximately one third of the patients."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Breast-feeding is associated with a lower rate of childhood illness in children with a family history of atopy."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve prostate cancer detection in enlarged prostates, as evidenced by a higher detection rate compared to systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. However, the study also suggests that the overall detection rate of magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy is lower than that of systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of regional anesthesia in geriatric patients with hip fracture is associated with a lower rate of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs compared to general anesthesia. However, the cost of hospitalization is higher in patients receiving regional anesthesia."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, direct mesocolon invasion from gastric cancer is a significant factor for the staging of gastric cancer, and should be included in the T4 classification for the staging of gastric cancer."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mutations in the LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1 genes can lead to decreased HDL cholesterol levels and increased apolipoprotein A-I levels, which in turn can promote increased carotid intima-media thickness."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D is a valid instrument for assessing the quality of life in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as indicated by a high correlation with MacNew subscales."}

The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the pattern of outpatient care, specifically the use of cardiology and general medicine clinics, is associated with improved survival in patients with congestive heart failure."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that there is no significant intrauterine influence on obesity levels in young women."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a marginally acceptable number of hearts from brain-dead donors can be suitable for transplantation, but the study also indicates that the degree of left ventricular dysfunction may influence the outcome. The study did not find a significant difference in survival between heart donors with a fractional area change of 50% and those with a fractional area change of 70% or above."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a practice that involves inducing hypoxia/anoxia to enhance sexual excitement, resulting in unintended death. The study describes the common manifestations, prevalence, age range, methods of inducing hypoxia/anoxia, and gender weighting of this practice. Pediatricians should be aware of the potential for miscommunication and loss of gamble with death."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "STIR imaging is a more accurate method for the detection of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T compared to T1w sequences, but it is inferior in sensitivity and image quality at 3 T."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The study found that Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) in the UK have varying levels of agreement when assessing a seafarer's fitness, with poor agreement for cardiovascular diseases and mental ill-health. Factors such as experience and knowledge of the MRs or their interpretation of the standards were the most common reasons for a change to fitness category or restrictions."}

{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that remote physician-examiners can be used to assess medical students in a traditional OSCE, and high levels of correlation were observed between the local examiner and the remote examiner."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal and adverse neonatal composite outcomes in women with suspected preeclampsia."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patient position during liver surgery does not significantly influence the risk of venous air embolism. However, the absolute pressures did vary in a predictable way."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "The study found that glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified glassworkers were at an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus, particularly in combination with cardiovascular disease."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current readiness guidelines for hospital emergency departments (EDs) for large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations do not accurately predict the severity of injuries resulting from these attacks. Further research is needed to improve the predictive power of these guidelines."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease, with a higher rate of eradication therapy given to patients with a definitive diagnosis."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the isolated right hemisphere may be able to read, but the relationship between reading skills and reading levels is not the same as in individuals with a dominant hemisphere resection."}

The splenic index (SI) was found to be the most accurate parameter."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy, as there was no significant difference in IL-1 alpha levels between the two groups. However, the study did find that lactate levels were higher for RRP at T2, T3, and T4."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the frequency of skin care protocol application can significantly impact the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients. The intervention group received a skin care protocol every 12 hours, while the control group received the protocol every 6 hours. The dermatitis score in the intervention group was significantly less than in the control group."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can lead to significant reductions in racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Insulin resistance is not the primary contributor to the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia is a useful tool for improving diagnosis and surgical treatment, particularly in cases where a wide carinal fistula is found. However, it should be noted that the study was conducted in a single institution and further research is needed to confirm these findings in other settings."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The 2009 TNM version of the staging system for kidney cancer is a valuable tool for primary tumor classification, but it does not retain an independent predictive role for survival. The study suggests that the novel classification of primary tumors, specifically pT1b and pT1c, may have a role in improving outcomes."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system does not accurately predict mortality, transfusion requirements, or non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parity is associated with increased insulin resistance during pregnancy, as indicated by decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and increased central glucose production."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cognitive function, specifically working memory, is a significant predictor of frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism in the ADRB2 gene is associated with an increased risk for transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) in newborns."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this pilot study do not support the conclusion that a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program improves bariatric surgery outcomes."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation.

The cumulative primary patency was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years. The limb salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and at 3 years."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) has good intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities and interobserver concordance (kappa) for measuring pupil diameters over 6.0 mm, with a sensitivity of 55.56% and specificity of 76.19%. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is between 5.4 mm and 6.2 mm."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with type 1 showing frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that increased patient awareness of clinical trials research can lead to increased participation in clinical trials research."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients at high risk of falls should receive inpatient rehabilitation and be assessed for falls risk factors, but the evidence for specific strategies is limited."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The expert consensus statement recommends that follow-up visits for patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) be conducted in a timely manner, with a minimum frequency of 0 to 16 weeks. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the number of follow-up visits between white and black patients."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CT attenuation values obtained with different scanners can not be used interchangeably, and the results should be considered in conjunction with the confidence intervals for each scanner model."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that sub-Bowman's keratomileusis is biomechanically safer than advanced surface ablation for corneal healing after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery, as evidenced by the presence of stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea in the anterior and peripheral areas. However, the long-term potential for corneal haze and breakthrough haze from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar is still present."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the Internet is a useful tool for improving sexual health awareness among young people, but it is important to note that access to the Internet is not a universal feature."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound is not superior to X-ray in the diagnosis of pediatric fractures, as it does not identify fracture type or dislocation. However, it is superior to X-ray in the detection of dislocation."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Retention of infected TKA is associated with lower infection control rates and shorter treatment duration compared to two-stage revision. However, the study did not find a significant difference in infection control rates or treatment duration between implant retention and two-stage revision."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that unmarried pregnant women in Poland have a higher risk for bacterial vaginosis, but the study did not find a significant association between unmarried status and maternal mortality."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of concept mapping enhances the learning outcome of nursing students, as evidenced by higher cumulative test scores and a more gradual increase in the mean scores of developed concept maps during the intervention period."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that serologic evidence of human cytomegalovirus infection is significantly associated with hypertension in both women and men. However, the association was no longer significant after adjusting for age."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form can lead to a significant improvement in quality of life for HIV/AIDS patients, but the ICUR for this strategy was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol and various chemotherapeutic compounds can result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine follow-up procedures for endometrial cancer surveillance, such as clinical visits, imaging, and cytologic examinations, can help identify asymptomatic recurrences and predict survival. However, the study also suggests that symptomatic relapses can be missed due to the lack of symptom detection and the need for additional tests."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a high infundibular height may be associated with a higher likelihood of stone clearance after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger sample sizes."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome.

{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that emergency double-balloon enteroscopy combined with real-time capsule endoscopy can be a feasible approach for the management of severe acute obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, with a diagnostic yield of 77.8%. However, the study also noted that the detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesion was higher in the emergency DBE group."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients who undergo laparoscopic antireflux surgery for patient preference experience improved quality of life compared to those who undergo medical therapy."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients in rural and regional areas of Australia are willing to participate in the new wave of community-based medical education, particularly in the areas of doctor-patient interaction and patient education."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with obstructive sleep apnea have a decreased aerobic fitness compared to a normal population."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that educational attainment moderates the effects of pictorial health warning labels on smoking-related health disparities. Educational attainment was found to influence the effectiveness of the labels, with didactic forms being consistently rated higher than testimonials among participants with higher education. However, the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative forms was weaker or not statistically significant among participants with lower education."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites are related to hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between family history of hyperlipidemia and serum lipid levels in school children."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa.

{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that growth hormone replacement therapy may increase mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency, but the effect is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that faculty examiners may be reasonable substitutes for student examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, as indicated by higher overall OSCE scores and ratings for certain stations. However, small effect sizes were reported in the post-assessment evaluation portion of the study."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in tissues of the anal canal is associated with an increased likelihood of estrogen-induced anal incontinence in women."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the overactive bladder symptom improvement between women with mixed incontinence who underwent midurethral sling repair and those who underwent midurethral sling alone. However, women with a postoperative complication had lower improvements in the overactive bladder symptom questionnaire."}
