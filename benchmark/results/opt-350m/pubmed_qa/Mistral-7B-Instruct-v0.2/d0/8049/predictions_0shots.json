{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy is associated with a lower overall survival and cancer-related death in invasive bladder cancer patients."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis may be a worthwhile investment in terms of radiation exposure and time, but it is important to note that the study did not find any significant benefit in the detection of renal mass or renal mass detection in the delayed phase imaging."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale does not directly identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors, but it is associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the rate of virological relapse between patients with e-antigen negative chronic hepatitis B who discontinued treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues and those who received adefovir, lamivudine, and adefovir alone."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The diameter of the aneurysm is a significant predictor of aortic aneurysm rupture, with a higher rupture rate observed in patients with larger aneurysms. However, the trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the use of a sternal skin conductance device for hot flashes measurement may be acceptable, but it should be used in a monitored setting and not in an ambulatory setting."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip to prevent contralateral hip fracture is a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral hip fracture, with a sensitivity to the effectiveness and relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure. However, the success of prophylactic fixation is highly sensitive to the effectiveness and relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the selection criteria used in the residency selection process can predict the performance of orthopaedic surgeons in orthopaedic surgery. The study found that objective measures of resident knowledge and performance, such as ABOS Part I scores, were associated with higher scores on the USMLE Step 2 scores and number of clinical honors received in medical school. Additionally, subjective ratings by faculty, such as global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents, were also associated with higher scores on the global evaluation."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF is a better predictor than age and FSH, as indicated by higher cancellation rates and higher pregnancy rates. However, it is important to note that antral follicle assessment may not be a definitive predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The timing of feeding tube insertion does not significantly impact survival in residents with advanced cognitive impairment. However, the timing of feeding tube insertion is associated with an increased risk of developing eating problems."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early discharge with nurse home visits can significantly impact the adequacy of newborn metabolic screening. The study found that infants on early discharge had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate compared to traditional stay infants, but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate. The early discharge group was more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high-dose radiotherapy (25 Gy applied in 5 fractions) can improve overall survival in palliative lung cancer patients, as evidenced by a median survival time of 21.8 weeks (21.8-39.2 weeks) and a median survival time of 28.2 weeks (14.2-41.8 weeks). However, the study also found that patients with a poor overall condition had a poorer median survival time."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis. However, when the patients were divided into the four subgroups, the most conspicuous finding was that group B contained no patients with both values unelevated."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in left ventricular function between patients who were induced with desflurane and those who were not induced with sufentanil or midazolam. However, desflurane did increase end-systolic wall-stress and left-ventricular stroke work index, and no change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change, left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening, or left ventricular circumferential fiber length was observed when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease is not solely due to the presence of gluten, but rather is influenced by other factors such as osteoporosis, bone mineral density, and gluten transgression."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the 2001 feeding recommendations for infants of HIV-infected mothers for a rural region in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, are appropriate for the needs of infants of HIV-infected mothers, with adequate micronutrients and essential fatty acids, cost, and preparation times, and a low cost of preparation time. However, the study also suggests that the commercial formula and home-prepared replacement milks provide adequate intake for vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, and selenium, while the commercial formula and home-prepared replacement milks provide insufficient intake for vitamin D and alpha-linolenic acid. The commercial formula and home-prepared replacement milks also provide insufficient amounts of"}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids can affect the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients, as evidenced by a decrease in the VAS score and a higher prevalence of eosinophilic inflammation in the airway wall. However, the relationship between eosinophilic inflammation and the airway is complex and may not be directly related to the airway obstruction."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that acceptance rates of preventive home visits among older people were socially imbalanced, with individuals with high financial assets accepting more frequently than those with low financial assets. However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by invitational procedures."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Comorbid major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence are associated with poorer outcomes of depression, particularly in adolescents. The study found that those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly higher rates of adult MD compared to those in the MD-only group, and marginally higher rates of adult MD compared to those in the MD-only group. The factors that explain the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "The study found that target motion in the superior portion of the prostate bed clinical target volume differed significantly from that in the inferior portion, with a mean total PB-CTV motion of -1.5 (\u00b11.4), 1.3 (\u00b12.4), and 3.7 (\u00b15.7) mm in LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively. However, no statistically significant differences were found between INF-CTV and SUP-CTV motion in any direction."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that octogenarians at high risk for carotid endarterectomy are at increased risk for symptomatic carotid stenosis, as indicated by a higher prevalence of asymptomatic stenosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and history of smoking. However, there were no deaths."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine can suppress T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens in mice, but the synergistic effect is not observed in the presence of antigen-presenting cells."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women.

{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "The presence of base deficit is a significant predictor of mortality in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury, with a negative correlation with Glasgow Coma Scale and Revised Trauma Score. However, there is no statistically significant difference in mean of BD between survivors and non-survivors."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria, is associated with an increase in blood histamine levels, suggesting an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence to suggest that laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly affects peri-sinusoidal cell activity."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in sleep and energy related problems in Japan is necessary for the improvement of sleep and energy quality, as indicated by a significant difference in regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries in men."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fluoroscopy is essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy. The study demonstrates that ureteroscopy can effectively complete the stone clearance without fluoroscopy, and that the procedure is safe and effective."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of injury severity surrogates, such as surgeons, is associated with an increased risk of heterotopic ossification in fractures of the acetabulum."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "The use of epidural analgesia for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with a higher risk of spinal haematoma, meningitis, and epidural abscess. However, no spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess were reported."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "Telemedicine and type 1 diabetes patients should consider the use of teleconsultation and insulin doses advisors to improve glycaemic control, as the study suggests that teleconsultation may improve the overall HbA1c levels but may not be sufficient to achieve the desired goal."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between early outcome measures and breast cancer screening in Sami speaking municipalities."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "The absence of ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure is associated with an increased risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation, but the risk is not significant for long-term stable sinus rhythm."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum pancreatic lipase can be used as a biomarker for acute pancreatitis, as evidenced by improved diagnostic accuracy and reduced risk of acute pancreatitis.

The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies migrate towards the heart through the esophagus, the pharynx, and the externalized in the submandibular region. The mechanisms and risks involved are discussed in this study."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that players and coaches do not fully understand the importance of wearing protective headgear to prevent concussion, with a significant number of players believing that it is not mandatory and that it costs too much. However, a majority of coaches do not believe that headgear should be made mandatory."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that early postoperative oral intake may be a potential alternative to laparoscopic surgery for reducing the risk of postoperative vomiting and hospitalization. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a definitive clinical utility."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) failures had significantly steeper medial and lateral posterior tibial slopes compared to those with ACLR failures."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly patients with acute stroke symptoms can correctly endorse the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is necessary to detect pneumothorax in some cases. However, the diagnosis is not definitive and the symptoms may still be present."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The timing of initial surfactant treatment in premature infants is associated with less duration of ventilation, longer duration of CPAP, longer hospital stay, and less impact on mortality."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that people who were passive smokers during childhood had an increased risk of long-term work disability."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant improvement in mandibular depiction when changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography images."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Chemoradiation (external beam radiation plus folinic acid) is a safe alternative to surgery for mid and low rectal tumors, with a lower overall survival rate and a lower clinical evaluation. However, it is important to note that local recurrence and perineural invasion are significant factors in the development of rectal carcinoma."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can be used to improve the predictive ability of risk models in conjunction with clinical assessment. The study found that the median Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 46.0 years for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2 carriers."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "Insulin 30/70 twice daily or bedtime isophane (NPH) insulin plus continued sulfonylurea and metformin (IC) can improve treatment outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients, with a greater improvement in HbA1c, treatment failure, weight gain, and general well-being compared to insulin monotherapy alone. However, the IC group had fewer treatment failures and had less weight gain. Fear of self-injecting and self-testing did not differ."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, with a high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy and a greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that intravenous infusion of epinephrine does not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Elevated neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is associated with an increased risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as evidenced by increased neutrophil migration across porous tissue cultures and a decline in neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT can be used as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease, as it shows a significant reduction in the left parietal cortex in the absence of memory provocation. However, it does not show significant differences in the clinical significance of the findings."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) can be an effective method for diagnosis of small bowel disorders, with a diagnostic yield of 75% and therapeutic yield of 63.6%. However, it is important to note that the study did not find major complications or major complications in the majority of cases."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis for reducing the number of patients with infarcts, as evidenced by higher satisfaction with overall care and lower delays in discharge and aftercare. However, it is important to note that the study also found that patients were less satisfied with the added inconvenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count is positively correlated with the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients. However, it is negatively correlated with the revised trauma score."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the optimal surgical timing for pulmonary valve replacement in adults after tetralogy of Fallot is not always clear, with some patients experiencing RV dilation and sudden cardiac death, while others may experience RV ejection fraction and RV volume changes. However, the study did not find a significant difference in RV volume or function between the two groups after PVR."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy by approximately 50%. However, it is important to note that the conversion rate is not a definitive measure of the effectiveness of the surgery. The study also suggests that the conversion rate may vary depending on the patient's age and the presence of residual disease."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "The mammography quality standards act has a significant impact on the mammography quality in North Carolina, with a significant increase in phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that HIE adoption is associated with reduced repeat imaging in emergency departments, as indicated by a reduction in the probability of repeat imaging in CT, ultrasound, and chest x-ray."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that misclassification of gestational age may contribute to the difference in birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "Yes, well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is clinically early cancer, with a lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation and a lower incidence of intrahepatic metastasis compared to l-d HCCs."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages.

{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that physician estimates of asthma severity were less accurate in black patients compared to white patients."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results can be expected to accurately report the total beta hCG and intact hCG levels. However, some laboratories may report both levels."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections is associated with a significant difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups. However, the difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that apoptosis in mesial temporal sclerosis is apoptotic, as evidenced by increased Bcl-2 immunoreactivity, Bax expression, and caspase activity."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "MiraLAX has a higher adenoma detection rate than Golytely in the study, but Golytely had a higher rate of a BBPS score \u2265 7."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp is associated with a higher risk of neoplastic polyps, particularly in older adults and those with hypertension."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in familial atrial fibrillation, as evidenced by increased current activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach for the detection and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen, which can be used for accurate and reliable analysis of pollen samples. The method can be used for both quantitative and qualitative analysis, with high accuracy and high throughput."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator can provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight, but the Ambu's inflated pressure is not consistent across different resuscitation models and the Neopuff's inflated pressure is also not consistent across resuscitation models."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant adverse influence on the quality of life in middle-aged women who remained premenopausal or entered perimenopause."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that confined placental mosaicism is associated with a lower incidence of perinatal complications compared to spontaneous conceptions in IVF/ICSI pregnancies. However, the incidence of chromosomal anomalies was increased in the IVF-ICSI group."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, with a significant difference in mortality rates between survivors and patients who died on day 10. However, the predicted mortality rate was significantly different from the observed mortality rate on day 10."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that perforation of the appendix is a risk factor for tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, trabecular bone is related to primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone blocks of different bone mineral densities, with lower trabecular bone thickness and in the absence of cortical bone being associated with lower primary stability."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, tuberculosis patients are adherent to prescribed treatments in China, with a higher prevalence of non-adherence compared to those who are supervised by family members and paying monthly service expenses. Factors such as family members and paying monthly service expenses are protective factors."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Yes, induction chemotherapy has a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as evidenced by a higher actuarial 2- and 5-year survival rates, local control, and local failure rates. However, the overall actuarial 2- and 5-year survival rates were similar between patients with and without induction chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and TGF-\u03b21, as well as increased steroid receptor expression."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "The presence of fragile esophageal mucosa in the esophagus is associated with an increased risk of dysphagia. The presence of this mucosa can be detected by endoscopy and can be treated with bouginage."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative platelet count is an independent prognostic factor for better 5-year survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients."}

{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty may be an effective alternative to nasal packing, as it resulted in shorter operating time and less bleeding. However, it is important to note that the study was conducted on a small sample size and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "The presence of articular sounds and physical signs can be insufficient to detect internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint, but imaging by static and dynamic high-resolution ultrasound can provide valuable diagnostic information."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum leptin levels are a significant prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population.

{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cytokines play a role in the development of epilepsy, with IL-1beta and IL-2 being detectable in some patients and IL-4 being detectable in others. However, the study also suggests that the presence of IL-1beta and IL-2 may not be a reliable indicator of epilepsy."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin plays a role in conferring insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The location and number of sutures placed for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding do not significantly impact reoperation rates. However, patients with fewer sutures had shorter OR time and shorter follow-up time."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage and a clear indication for anticoagulation can be anticoagulated, as shown by improved quality-adjusted life expectancy and reduced risk of thromboembolic stroke. However, the choice of anticoagulation strategy should be based on the patient's risk of thromboembolic stroke and the risk of thromboembolic stroke itself."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that (18)F-FDG is a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia in mouse tumors, as evidenced by a decrease in similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that treadmill training may have a positive impact on the secondary benefits of walking slower than pre-stroke, mobility, and social participation, as indicated by improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases, with a prevalence of approximately 68.7% in the study population. However, the clinical characteristics of patients with orthostatic myoclonus and their underlying neurological disorders suggest that it may be associated with neurological disorders, such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal pressure hydrocephalus."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a trauma center level may have a significant impact on mortality and hospital length of stay in severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical significance of this finding."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a uniform expression profile for the basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of the \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO) in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to lead to significant HIV transmission reduction, particularly in the sub-Saharan Africa region. The policy will lead to increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and the implementation of measures to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly estimate the upcoming burden. These are required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that chest wall rigidity may be a factor in the rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse, as evidenced by a lack of detectable norfentanyl in half of the cases. However, the study also suggests that fentanyl may be a potential cause of acute chest rigidity, as indicated by a high fentanyl concentration in the therapeutic range."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in live birth rates or severe OHSS rates between women with ovaries of polycystic morphology and those with PCOS without any other features of PCOS."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide adequate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask, as shown in the first scenario. However, the pediatric bag was used in the second scenario and the pediatric BVM was used in the third scenario. The pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult-sized bag."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "The presence of a polyp in the colon does not necessarily indicate an advanced adenoma. However, it is important to note that colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis is not a definitive diagnosis and may not be the only option for managing the condition. Other factors such as age, gender, and other clinical factors may also influence the outcome."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant cardiovascular evaluations during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas. However, there were no significant complications or adverse events."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus, as it has shown to be effective in improving or curing type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to note that the specific criteria for gastric bypass are complex and may vary between types."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet, with a significant number of drivers believing that ESC has made it safer to drive and reporting being confident that ESC will work in an emergency."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Yes, clinical supervision can sustain our workforce in the current healthcare landscape, as evidenced by the positive correlation between clinical supervision effectiveness and the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the relationship between 'economic/employment' and'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion is stronger in females than males. The influence of'social/welfare' dimension is more pronounced in females than in males."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound assessment in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis can provide valuable information for assessing the extent and invasion into the corpora spongiosum, as evidenced by the presence of hypoechoic lesions and absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, health care providers have a significant knowledge base regarding the proper use of metered-dose inhalers, with a significant percentage of patients having poor understanding of the technique used. House staff and nursing staff are the most knowledgeable of the health care providers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the transverse apex of the vertebra is associated with the coronal apex levels in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The TEAM sample generalizes to include subjects with child bipolar I disorder, but it does not specifically address the characteristics of child bipolar I disorder."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a broad consensus among country experts on most factors for health care for immigrants in Europe, with some differences in the criteria for selecting factors. However, there was a significant divergence between countries on the need for prioritising cultural differences, and between countries on the need for more consistent governance of health care services for immigrants."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "The fibronectin-aggrecan complex (IL-6) is present in cervical disk disease, but its concentration is lower than that of interferon-\u03b3 and MCP."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that affect-regulated exercise intensity led to an increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group compared to control. This increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold was associated with improved physical health."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both hepatitis G virus and TT virus are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease, with hepatitis G virus being more common in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease and TT virus being more common in those with hepatitis C virus liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints are a stronger predictor of subsequent symptoms of depression than income and age."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study identified early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including high inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index values, as well as a significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that inhibin concentrations in serum samples from patients with hydatidiform mole may be associated with persistent trophoblastic disease, suggesting its potential as a clinical marker. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish its clinical utility."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CAD software can provide valuable diagnostic information in MR-mammography, but it does not provide the highest accuracy for the most suspect curve, curve-type distribution percentage, combined dynamic data, or combined dynamic data. The sensitivity and specificity for these parameters are 80.4% and 72.7%, respectively."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fear of anaphylaxis and dissemination are the main reasons for not adopting minimal access techniques for laparoscopic and percutaneous treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and postpartum hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with major depression in pregnancy are identified in population health data through the use of demographic and demographic information, including the presence of a comorbidity, as well as the use of medication records. The prevalence of depression in this population is around 16%."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that general practice characteristics, such as staff type, year, and number of registered diabetic patients, were associated with variations in the uptake of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurses are better than a simple objective score in predicting admission at triage, as shown by a higher accuracy and better calibration. However, the accuracy of GAPS is also better than that of triage data, with a higher accuracy of 92.4% compared to VAS's 89.0%."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between vitamin D deficiency and the development of celiac disease in prepubertal children with celiac disease. However, the study did find that the non-obese children had a higher 25(OH)D level compared to the obese normal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis, and myelotoxicity. The clinical course and management of this patient are presented as well as a review of the incidence and outcome of severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that healthier lifestyles, such as exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, drinking habits, and regular blood pressure measurement, are associated with a lower utilization of healthcare resources."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a lower adolescent smoking susceptibility, as indicated by a significant correlation between smoking susceptibility and the presence of parental R-rated movie viewing."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "Yes, managed care programs can lead to more low-income persons identifying a usual source of care, as indicated by a lower likelihood of having a usual physician and a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant reduction in post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that artificial chords can be used in routine mitral valve repair, with a high rate of repair and no de-insertion or rupture of neochords. However, the stability of neochord implantation was not found to be a significant issue."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio (EOA) can be improved by adjusting for patient anatomy and valve dimensions, but the difference in valve size was not significant."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical help for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction, with longer delays for women compared to men, and shorter delays for women who were not advised to call 911."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction in children with recurrent bacterial bronchitis is a forerunner to bronchiectasis. The study found that bronchiectasis and PBB patients had significantly lower phagocytic capacity compared to control subjects and control subjects. Additionally, bronchiectasis patients had a lower median phagocytosis of NTHi compared to control subjects."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment can improve tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus, as indicated by a decrease in TFI and NBQ-scores, as well as a significant improvement in NBQ-scores."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was positively related to an increase in ambulatory blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant differences in fetal biometric parameters measured during fetal life between contemporary fetal population and those from 35 years ago."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between body mass index and prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age. However, a 10-point body mass index increase was associated with a prostate specific antigen difference of -0.03 ng/ml."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "The 30-day mortality and age-related 30-day mortality following emergency laparotomy are significant issues for the management of patients in general surgery. The study suggests that a significant proportion of patients experience a significant decrease in 30-day mortality and age-related 30-day mortality following laparotomy. However, the study also suggests that the overall mortality rate is higher in those aged under 70 years compared to those aged under 70 years."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The present study provides evidence for a causative link between cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis. The child had a history of infantile encephalopathy since birth, microcephaly, and mental retardation, and recurrent infections. The diagnosis was based on a culture of a vertebral biopsy. The immunological work-up was normal."}

{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is safe, with a high incidence of complications and a low mortality rate. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant association between anticoagulation and hemorrhage in trauma patients."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a significant difference in dental health between new recruits to the British Armed Forces and those in the Royal Navy or Air Force. However, the study did not find a significant difference in dental fitness between the two services."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli, as evidenced by a lack of within-group differences in attentional biases."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' low performance on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public value health care interventions more highly than those in contexts where the health care system is not responsible for their safety."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a dose reduction to one parotid gland may prevent xerostomia in some cases, but it does not completely eliminate the risk of dryness of the mouth. The study also suggests that some patients may still experience symptoms of dryness of the mouth, but the risk of severe dryness of the mouth is low."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily may need to continue folic acid supplements for a longer period of time, as there was an increased incidence of neutropenia and nausea in the placebo group. However, the study did not find a significant difference in efficacy between the two groups."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that laparoscopic fundectomy is safe and effective as a revision surgery for patients with residual fundus/neofundus development, as evidenced by a significant improvement in weight loss, weight regain, and improved GERD symptoms. However, the presence of a residual fundus/neofundus was associated with an increased risk of complications."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the CT slice location where visceral adipose tissue area can best reflect changes in visceral adipose tissue volume can be used as a useful tool for risk monitoring. The study found that a slice 3 cm above the lower margin of L3 with r values of 0.853 and 0.902 was the strongest correlation between visceral adipose tissue area and body weight changes."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining can be used as a diagnostic tool for short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, as it is associated with a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to cytokeratin 7/20 immunohistochemistry."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the lunar position influences the time of delivery in multiparae and plurigravidae. The mean day of delivery corresponds to the first or second day after the full moon."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are cost-effective, with a significant increase in cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted life years, and direct costs to the NHS. However, further research is needed to confirm these results and establish a reliable cost-effectiveness model."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay ward in a general and academic children's hospital is a useful addition to the emergency service, with a higher rate of admissions and a lower rate of patient follow-up. However, it is important to note that the short stay ward is developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease can be used as a predictor of failure or relapse, with a higher likelihood of achieving remission when both radiological and histological findings are positive. However, the likelihood of achieving remission is also higher when both modalities are negative."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Chronic functional somatic symptoms are associated with increased use of somatic and psychotropic drugs, and hospital admissions rates are higher for patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms compared to controls."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The decision to refer to the multidisciplinary team for breast cancer management is based on the patient's choice and the team's assessment of the patient's health and risk factors. The decision to accept the recommendation of the multidisciplinary team may be influenced by the patient's choice and the team's assessment of the patient's risk factors."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "Panton-Valentine leucocidin is associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK, with a prevalence of approximately 36% in isolates from patients hospitalized in 25 centres. The study identified four distinct strains of the toxin gene, with the two isolates from Ireland being related."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dogs can prime autistic children for therapy, as evidenced by increased positive behaviors, shorter durations of negative behaviors, and less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with increased insulin resistance, as indicated by lower levels of specific insulin and des 31,32 proinsulin, and increased insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that postictal psychotic episodes II are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes, with a higher likelihood of developing an IPE over an 8-year follow-up period."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion can predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients, as shown by a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity 98.2%."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the infection rate."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "The study found that EMS professionals who had participated in disease prevention programs were more likely to report providing prevention services during emergency calls, and those who had provided prevention services during emergency calls were more likely to think EMS professionals should provide prevention services during emergency calls."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients with CKD are adequate, with a mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level increase of > or = 5 ng/ml and a significant decrease in iPTH level in 54% of treated patients. However, only 25% of patients achieved levels > or = 30 ng/ml."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain intensity at admission is a significant predictor of a poor opioid response in cancer patients. Patients with response 'b' and 'd' showed higher values of OEImg."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that treatment as prevention (TasP) strategies can be effective in maintaining viral load suppression over time, with a median duration of 14 years and a high prevalence of undetectable VL. However, the study also suggests that third-line ART regimens may be more effective than first- or second-line ART regimens in achieving viral load suppression."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis exhibit pyloric mucosal hypertrophy, which is characterized by a thickened pyloric mucosa and obstructive pyloric muscle. The presence of pyloric mucosal redundancy may contribute to the development of IHPS."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Infants with false-positives in TEOAE and AABR are more likely to be admitted into well-baby nursery, belong to mothers who attended antenatal care, and have severe hyperbilirubinemia. However, no association was found between false-positives and true-negatives. Antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type were useful predictors of discordant outcomes among all infants undergoing screening."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management at the same centre can improve the overall survival and disease-free survival of colorectal cancer patients, as indicated by a lower number of procedures and a lower number of deaths. However, the overall survival rate is higher in SM patients."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors, with pleomorphic adenomas being more common in myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas being more common in myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas being more common in myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas being more common in myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas being more common in myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas being more common in myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas being more common in myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas being more common in myoepit"}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "UK radiologists are satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with a significant proportion of departments having a dedicated paediatric radiologist to report their skeletal surveys. However, only a small percentage of departments have ready access to expert evidence."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the changes in serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that behavioural risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol intake, and HIV infection, are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive status in Black South Africans. However, the study also suggests that alcohol intake may be a more significant predictor of hypertension than smoking."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV was more likely to report having worse physical symptom burden compared to the clinic sample, while the clinic sample was less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the psychological symptom burden between the two samples."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups can provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, but the contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint is not acceptable."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians are associated with a lower risk of mortality, but the study also suggests that the long-term outcomes may be poorer. The Barthel Index of the survivors was 89\u00b117, and the New York Heart Association class was 2\u2009\u00b11. The study also suggests that the long-term outcomes may be poorer."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, open access endoscopy can significantly reduce the amount of information required for informed consent and procedure acceptance, as well as improve patient medical complexity and overall patient satisfaction."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that uterine myomas grow during pregnancy, with a significant percentage of myomas becoming smaller and enlarging. However, the percentage of myomas that become smaller and enlarged was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the association between birth characteristics and intellectual performance in early adulthood is confounded by socioeconomic factors, with men born light for gestational age experiencing an increased risk of low intellectual performance compared to those born with appropriate birth weight for gestational age."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that double reading of barium enemas can be effective in reducing the incidence of adenocarcinomas, but it is important to note that the study did not find a significant difference in sensitivity between the first and combined readings. The sensitivity of the first reading was 89.0%, while the combined reading was 86.4%. The overall measurement of agreement decreased from a kappa value of 61.8 to 52.9 for the first reading to a kappa value of 52.9 for the combined reading. The second reading required an average of 3.3 minutes."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications, as evidenced by a decrease in incision scars, functional conditions of the auriculotemporal nerve, and facial nerve, and a decrease in the number of complications. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the number of complications between patients undergoing the VMPA and those who did not."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery is not necessary for the survival of patients with primary lung cancer. However, the staging results of most patients do not show a significant influence on survival."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant change in antiepileptic drug prescription claims following the FDA suicidality warning. However, the trend was observed in the first half of the study period, but it was not observed during the subsequent period."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study found that self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors were significantly more accurate than government records. However, the correlation between self-reports and government records was only up to 56 percent in the 5 years before study entry."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates that communication with terminally ill patients can be taught through a 2-day course model, with significant improvements in communication skills and professionalism."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, peer review plays a significant role in assessing the quality of care for chronic disease conditions, particularly for conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. The study found that the reliability of implicit chart reviews for COPD and a collection of acute conditions was significantly higher for diabetes and hypertension compared to other conditions."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that failure to perform IUD insertion attempts in community practice is an under-recognized problem, with a higher odds ratio in nulliparous women compared to parous women."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction can be economically viable, with a savings of approximately US $5,098 to US $1,231.50."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by polarity, with bipolar participants having more severe attempts and bipolar participants having more severe attempts during follow-up."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites results in a significant number of acute side effects, including urticaria, urticaria-related complications, and acute side effects such as acute side effects of antivenin in some patients. However, the overall incidence of these side effects is low."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that left ventricular regional wall motion did not significantly change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients. However, the New York Heart Association functional class improved to class I in 40% and class II in 43% of patients postoperatively."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fractional lasers enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, as evidenced by increased lidocaine levels and MEGX levels."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that some practices, such as child health clinics, may not be aware of the appropriate storage conditions for vaccines in the community, and may not monitor their temperatures to ensure adequate storage."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that p53 alterations can be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer, with a reduction in tumour size and local failure being observed in the groups with p53 overexpression or p53 mutation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation therapy may be a useful adjuvant therapy for necrotizing fasciitis, as it improves patient mortality and outcomes, but the benefit is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients are being treated with higher doses of zonisamide compared to those with epilepsy in the general population. The study found that patients with epilepsy had a higher dose of ZNS compared to those with epilepsy in the general population. However, the efficacy of ZNS was only observed in 5% of patients."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that increased Ki-67 expression is an independent prognostic factor for both cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival in upper tract urinary carcinoma patients."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide valuable information for the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, but it does not replace arthroscopy for the diagnosis and monitoring of these injuries. The findings from this study suggest that MRI may be a more effective tool for the detection and characterization of these injuries."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that aphasia and dementia in motor neuron disease are associated with a lower prevalence of cognitive dysfunction and language deficits compared to non-demented patients."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the sensation returned to the nasal tip after microfat injections, with a gradual decline in touch threshold value. However, the percentage of patients experiencing paresthesia after the procedure also gradually diminished."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that communication disorders, specifically severe to profound hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder, may impact the accuracy of musical messages in children with severe hearing loss. However, the CI group was significantly less accurate than the other two groups in identifying both emotions and movements."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The use of colour to describe osteoarthritis pain is generally acceptable, but it does not provide a definitive way to describe pain, as it does not represent a definitive way of describing pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain, but some chose grey or black to describe sharp pain. The use of colour to describe pain is not a definitive way of describing pain, as it does not represent a definitive way of describing pain."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that intensive chemotherapy regimens for rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers are safe, with a low rate of serious adverse events and a low rate of toxic death. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the rate of febrile neutropenia or diarrhoea between urban and rural patients."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Surgery or radiation therapy can significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival in patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers, particularly for those with multivariate analysis. However, age, gender, stage, radiation, and surgery to be independent predictors of survival."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the incidence of delayed gastric emptying following pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy is significantly reduced by modifying the original reconstructive anatomy with a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy towards an antecolic duodenojejunostomy. However, the overall incidence of DGE was only 12%."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly more common in women with pelvic organ prolapse, particularly in those with a history of pelvic pain."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence that c-kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is mediated by autocrine stimulation pathways, suggesting a potential therapeutic target."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in diabetic rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The majority of U.S. transplant centers do not require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients, and many would not transplant an HIV-infected patient into a transplantation. However, some centers fear that transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual, and some believe that it would be a waste of precious organs."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is not a reliable method for assessing the extent of disease or metastases, as it does not provide accurate information on the extent of fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, it is a useful tool for assessing the extent of disease or metastases, as it can provide additional information on the extent of disease or metastases."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ, as it significantly influences the assessment of local recurrence risk and treatment recommendation."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vaginal pH measurement from the wet mount slide can be performed using a cotton swab, wooden spatula, or a cotton swab. However, the accuracy of the measurement is dependent on the sampling devices used and the diagnosis of the vaginal infections."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that an HIV-positive patient is more at risk of presenting with a plunging ranula type oral mucocele/ranula."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The correlation coefficient between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index is 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), and the correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index is 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02-0.21)."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in D-dimer serum levels between histopathologic study groups between patients with acute appendicitis and those with normal D-dimer levels. However, there was a significant difference in the ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death. The study demonstrates that mitochondrial dynamics are similar to those of non-PCD cells, and that lace plant leaves exhibit reduced perforations compared to controls."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Transurethral catheterisation is a more common method of bladder drainage than standard bladder catheterisation, but it is associated with a higher incidence of clinically significant urinary tract infections."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, risk stratification of gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever is useful in assessing their risk for complications, ICU admission, overall mortality, and overall mortality due to neutropenic fever. The study found that high-risk patients had a higher risk of developing complications, multiple severe complications, ICU admission, overall mortality, and death due to neutropenic fever compared to low-risk patients."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Halofantrine ototoxic, as it is known, can lead to loss and distortion of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells, as well as loss of spiral ganglia cells."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "The elderly with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are not receiving aggressive treatment and are not receiving the benefit of aggressive therapy. However, the study did find that age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 had significant benefits in DSS with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that minimal access surgery in newborns may not significantly impact postoperative pain scores, as evidenced by a similar trend for opioid consumption. However, the study also suggests that opioid consumption may be reduced in neonates undergoing minimal access surgery compared to those undergoing conventional surgery."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find that clinical predictors are adequate for the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, with lower protein, fat, and saturated fat intakes compared to baseline. However, the dietary recommendations for adequate nutrient intakes are not followed in individuals with type 1 diabetes."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the patella position plays a significant role in the balancing of ligament gaps in total knee arthroplasty. The study found that knee extension and flexion positions showed smaller gaps in the reduced, subluxated and everted positions compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. Additionally, there were significant cases of variability in knee flexion position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Mossy fibers release GABA through synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal cells, which are mediated by NMDA receptors."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women are more likely to report depression symptoms compared to men, and this effect is more pronounced in women."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "Yes, delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer are associated with an increased risk of mortality."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ADMA levels in young adults born preterm are significantly correlated with gestational age and birth weight, and are associated with an increased risk of endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence assays can improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet subjects, as shown by a significant improvement in the receiver operating characteristic curves with a positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that both antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) levels were significantly higher in patients with relapsing-remitting MS compared to healthy donors."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a histologic pattern of diffuse pulmonary disease, characterized by multiple lung nodules and a biopsy of a pulmonary lesion. The absence of improvement in the lungs after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a significant factor in the development of AFOP."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a higher percentage of women who received antenatal corticosteroid for premature preterm rupture of membranes (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.06-7.17) and delivered within 1 week of the administration were likely to deliver at<34 weeks. However, the study also suggests that the delivery of at<34 weeks may be more likely to occur in those who received AC for premature preterm rupture of membranes."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is a higher prevalence of fatigue in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome compared to lupus patients. However, the study did not find a significant association between the two conditions."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter is a significant predictor of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux. The study found that a distal ureteral diameter of 5.5 mm (2.5-13mm) was significantly associated with reflux resolution."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that HINT1 is a candidate for schizophrenia, as it has been shown to have different expression levels in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. However, the sex effect was not observed in this study."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is clinically relevant, as it shows better prognosticating 1-year independent ambulation than with the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, schizophrenia is associated with structural brain abnormalities, including decreases in whole brain volume, whole brain gray matter, frontal gray and white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter volume, as well as larger increases in lateral ventricular volume, compared to healthy controls."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels are preoperatively associated with an increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The risk of 30 day and 1 year mortality is 1.7 (95% CI: 0.5-5.5) and 2.9 (CI: 1.1-7.2) with impaired fasting blood glucose levels, respectively."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, with a higher plasma elimination rate and higher ISF penetration."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is an early stage, with a high prevalence of T1N0 and T2N0 disease, and a high prevalence of positive resection margins. However, the prognosis is not good for those with T1N0 disease."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, gout patients are more likely to know their goal than gout-specific knowledge questions. However, the association between knowledge and health outcomes is not strong."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded, low-income vision care programs improve the utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals, with a prevalence ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex, and education."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural or urban residence significantly increases the risk of neonatal mortality and stillbirth in premature infants born to mothers residing in rural areas."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that endothelin-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypotension and rebound hypertension during hemodialysis, as indicated by increased ET-1 levels in dialysis patients and decreased ET-1 levels in the control group. However, the study did not find a significant difference in ET-1 concentration between the two groups."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the sensitivity of frozen section evaluation during thyroid surgery for multinodular thyroid disease between patients with and without frozen section."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared to younger cancer patients, with the older group expressing more urgent needs and the younger group expressing less urgent needs."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "Globulomaxillary cysts, as defined by the findings of this study, do not actually exist. The findings suggest that the cysts may be associated with other pathological processes, such as adenomatoid odontogenic tumours, periapical granuloma, residual cyst, and undefined jaw cyst."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of recurrence is closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, and psychological/socio-demographic factors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials have a poorer prognosis compared to those without symptoms. Older adults with 3 symptoms have a higher admission rate, complications, and greater decline in functional status."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea can lead to improved sleep quality and overall life quality, as indicated by a statistically significant improvement in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire, Fatigue Severity Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a statistically significant improvement in the FOSQ, PSQI, FSS, SF-36, or BDI. The study also noted that the use of heated humidification was added to improve the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program does not significantly impact old-age disability in the elderly population. However, the study did find that higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates, and this effect was not significant for married individuals."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that global loss of passive range of movement, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, and global loss of glenohumeral movements are associated with a positive anesthetic response in early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis patients. However, the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a significant number of children who do not follow the instructions and administer cough and cold medicines correctly, leading to unnecessary use and unnecessary hospitalization."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that vitamin C may prevent the development of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures. The study found that the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was 4.2% in the vitamin C group and 10.1% in the placebo group, and all of the affected patients were elderly women. Early cast-related complaints were associated with the development of complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, plate clearing is associated with an increased risk of obesity in an environment where food is abundant."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) in detecting clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not a reliable indicator of clinical suspicion, as the presence of ACS was not clinically suspected before obtaining CXR results. However, the sensitivity of CXR was only 39%, and diagnostic accuracy did not improve significantly with increasing levels of pediatric training."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that colorectal trainees perform better than consultants in terms of quality of TME surgery, but there is no statistically significant difference in terms of quality of mesorectal excision."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the school food policy at Dutch primary schools may need to be strengthened to improve the effectiveness of the policy and the compliance of parents. However, the findings suggest that parents' opinions on the school food policy vary, with some believing that the school should enforce the policy more strongly, others feeling that it is a responsibility of the school to foster healthy eating habits among children, and others believing that it is also a responsibility of the school to foster healthy eating habits among children."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that eye-tracking abnormality in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception, leading to increased speed discrimination thresholds and frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "The Cleveland Clinic Continence Score and anastomotic leakage do not significantly differ in functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer. However, the maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance were slightly worse after leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) does not significantly impact neurologic outcomes. However, the presence of OPLL in the motor function group was associated with a lower ASIA motor score and a higher mean improvement rate in motor function."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences are associated with height, with men scaling to height with circumferences of 0.76 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.45 \u00b1 0.05, respectively, in men and 0.80 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.53 \u00b1 0.04, respectively, in women. Age- and race-adjusted incremental increases in circumferences ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per centimeter increase in height. Both height and circumferences were negatively affected by health status."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a prevalence of 50% in the most frequent complaints and a 6-month prevalence of 75.5%. The most common complaints are low back pain, headache, and shoulder and neck pain, with affective disorders being the most common. Patients with neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders have the highest prevalence."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Age does not significantly influence the coping strategies of older adults with personality disorder, but it does influence the coping strategies of younger adults with personality disorder. Older adults report lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies and lower levels of personality disorder, while younger adults report higher levels of dysfunctional coping strategies and lower levels of personality disorder."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between cervical cord plaques and cervical discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine laboratory parameters such as liver biopsies, AST/ALT ratio, and sex are useful in distinguishing nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis. The MCV, AST/ALT ratio, and age are independent predictors of high-grade fibrosis."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that immediate breast reconstruction does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, as there was no significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy between the two groups. However, there was a higher risk of return to surgery and seromas in the IBR group."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis holds that economic inequalities in cancer screening coverage are significantly lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage, for both breast cancer screening and cervical cancer screening."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in post-tonsillectomy morbidity between children and adults undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. However, the administration of antibiotics had no significant effect on pain control, fever, secondary hemorrhage, or reduction in hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patient-rated depression severity monitoring can be a useful tool in clinical psychiatry, with a high prevalence of changes in antidepressant medication dosage and antidepressant medication changes occurring in approximately 90% of patient contacts. However, it is important to note that the study also found that some practices did not adopt the measure and that some changes were not immediately apparent."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in the number of intraoperative complications, pain, social functioning, or mobility scores between the two groups of patients treated with an intramedullary nail and those treated by sliding compression hip screw."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme was found to be effective in reducing physical disability, pain, and general health scores in rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, only 57% of patients passed all physical tests."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality is associated with a higher mortality risk in the West compared to the rest of the country. However, this relationship does not vary between regions in any of the models."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study identified specific characteristics and actions of effective therapists, including effectively addressing patient avoidance, language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance, that contribute to the effective implementation of evidence-based treatments."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "The study found that a 10% own-ethnic density increase in London boroughs was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of depression for some groups, but not for others. The effect was not significant for black Caribbean patients."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that dynamic postural stability, as measured by the center of pressure-center of mass moment arm during gait initiation, is positively correlated with knee extensor strength, while functional extensor strength is negatively correlated with dynamic stability. Additionally, functional ambulation is negatively correlated with disease severity and positively correlated with knee extensor strength."}

Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic antibiotics are necessary for the successful placement of totally implantable venous access devices (TIVADs) without antibiotic prophylaxis. However, the number of cases of CLABSIs and chemotherapeutic agents used in the procedure may vary."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that autologous platelet-rich plasma gel may enhance healing after mandibular third molars extraction, as indicated by lower pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening, but this effect is not statistically significant in the control group."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that physicians overestimate patients' symptoms and worsen their quality of life, while physicians underestimate the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients. The study found that patients with MetS had significantly increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica is not significantly influenced by the presence of certain factors, such as the presence of female sex, HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles, PV>or = 2.00 mPa s, or initial prednisolone dose. However, the risk of relapse and late development of GCA is reduced by starting treatment at a higher dose."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that surgical resection is not necessary for the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus, as the median disease-free survival was observed in both arm A and B. However, the recurrence rate was higher in arm A than in arm B."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism is based on beta-endorphin deficiency, as evidenced by a decrease in beta-E levels and an inverse relationship between beta E and craving."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of private health care significantly reduces the demand for NHS care, as indicated by a lower private referral rate in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared to the least deprived fifth."}

The incidence of X-chromosome inactivation was similar in both groups, with a higher incidence in the Primiparous group. The incidence of X-inactivation skewing was not statistically different between the Primiparous and Multiparous groups."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of daily pain for dying nursing home residents, as evidenced by a lower proportion of hospice residents receiving analgesics and a higher proportion of nonhospice residents receiving regular treatment. However, the use of acetaminophen and morphine derivatives was more common in hospice residents."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care.

{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "Oophorectomy is necessary in approximately half of cases of ovarian torsion in children, but it is not a definitive treatment option for all cases. The risk of complications and length of stay is higher in the detorsion group."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is not sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis, as the image quality is significantly lower in the 0.5 mL/second group compared to the 1 mL/second group."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is a significant increase in reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV-infected individuals over time. Females, 15-30 year olds, and those with HIV-positive partners were more likely to report unsafe sex. However, there was no evidence of a response bias over time."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that pneumologists' skepticism towards cytostatic treatment is justified, as it was found to be an independent predictor of survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of cytostatic treatment in this population."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, providers and primary care case management programs in Florida's Medicaid program have lower expenditures compared to HMOs or primary care case management."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire can be used to identify individuals with partial androgen deficiency of aging men, but it is not a definitive diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of PADAM. The tool rendered a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting PADAM, but it did not significantly increase the risk of hypogonadism."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor, as evidenced by a positive predictive value for predicting fetal acidosis in term and preterm fetuses, as well as a false negative rate for predicting no acidosis."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that emergency ultrasound fellowship programs significantly increase the number of scans performed in emergency medicine residents, as well as the number of applications of bedside US in the emergency department."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obesity is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, heart attacks, and respiratory rate in children."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that abscesses, phlegmon, or recurrent disease are contraindications to laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease. However, the study also suggests that conversion to open procedure is the longest in the group with the most complications."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year in which radical prostatectomy is performed is a significant predictor of outcome in prostate cancer patients."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women with a history of major depression had a lower risk of developing major depression during midlife compared to women without a history. However, women with a prior history had a higher risk profile. The study also found that psychological symptoms and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for first-onset MDD."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that early extubation is an important goal for children after congenital heart surgery, with a higher rate of successful extubation and shorter hospital stays compared to delayed extubation. However, implementation of an early extubation strategy is associated with low rates of complications, short hospital stays, and short hospital stays."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors such as occupational silica, solvent, and metal exposure are significant factors in the development of primary systemic vasculitis."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the lateral structures of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are safe with the use of flexible reamer systems at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion, but there is a trend towards longer distances to the common peroneal nerve and femoral attachment of the LCL."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "The treatment duration does not significantly impact the outcome after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. The 10-year freedom from biochemical failure rate is higher in the low-risk group and high-risk group compared to the intermediate-risk group, high-risk group, or all risk groups combined."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis is safe, with a positive predictive value of 100%. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the survival rate between patients with mitral and aortic prostheses and those with both prostheses."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Acute hepatitis C infection in Israel is predominantly iatrogenic, with a significant proportion of patients reporting iatrogenic transmission through injection drug use. The most frequent mode of transmission is iatrogenic involving several, often minimal, procedures and clinical settings. The most common transmission routes include oral, syringe, and injection drug use."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, breast-feeding is associated with lower rates of childhood illness both in the first and first three years of life, as well as fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve prostate cancer detection rates in patients with enlarged prostates, as indicated by a significant inverse association between magnetic resonance imaging volume and prostate cancer detection."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the introduction of regional anesthesia and analgesia programs in geriatric patients with hip fracture significantly reduces morbidity, mortality, and health care costs."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, direct mesocolon invasion into the mesocolon is considered a more likely staging option for gastric cancer patients undergoing surgery for advanced gastric carcinoma."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mutations in the LCAT and ABCA1 genes, specifically the APOA1 mutation, can lead to increased carotid intima-media thickness."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Turkish version of the EQ-5D is a valid quality of life instrument in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as indicated by a significant correlation with MacNew global score."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that specialty care, specifically general medicine and cardiology clinic visits, was associated with improved survival in patients with congestive heart failure. The risk of death was 1.12 (0.94-1.34) in the cardiology group, 1.26 (1.15-1.38) in the GM-only group, and 1.48 (1.28-1.72) in the no-GM/CARD group."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the intrauterine influence on obesity is stronger than the paternal influence, with maternal body mass index (BMI) being stronger than paternal BMI in both parents."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Transesophageal echocardiography assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead donors can be a useful tool for assessing left ventricular dysfunction, but it is not a reliable tool for determining the degree of left ventricular dysfunction. The study suggests that the degree of left ventricular dysfunction may vary depending on the donor's age and the donor's condition."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a complex and often-unexplained phenomenon, characterized by a clandestine and elusive practice, which can lead to unintended death. The study provides valuable information on the clinical and theoretical formulations of AEA, including the identification of the syndrome, the willingness to discuss concerns, and the potential for intervention. The findings suggest that autoerotic asphyxiation may be a reenactment of intense emotional feeling-states involving an identification and sadomasochistic relationship with a female figure."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, STIR imaging can be used to diagnose bone metastases at both 1.5 T and 3 T, with a sensitivity of 99.72% and 100.00% for STIR imaging compared to STIR imaging at both field strengths. However, STIR imaging at 1.5 T is more accurate and has a better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation, and improved image quality compared to STIR imaging at 3 T."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approved doctors and medical referees in the UK have a poor agreement when assessing seafarer fitness, with the majority of cases being classed as category 4 \"permanently unfit\" or category 2 \"fit with restrictions\". However, the overall agreement was poor for cardiovascular diseases and mental ill-health conditions."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women with more parities had significantly higher glomerular hyperfiltration levels compared to those without a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or complicated pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of a fast-resorbable hydrogel coating on implants can reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro, as evidenced by a decrease in bacterial and biofilm activity in the presence of antibacterial agents."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity plays a significant role in the location of death for BAME groups who died of cancer. The study found that hospital deaths were more likely for those born in the UK, Europe, Asia, and Caribbean, while home deaths were less likely for those born in Asia, Africa, and 'other' geographical regions."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have a higher risk for Lynch syndrome. The study identified five additional cases of Lynch syndrome, all medium-risk, and identified a germline mutation in MSH2 and MLH1. None of the low-risk patients had molecular results consistent with a germline mutation."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is an indicator of congenital cytomegalovirus infection, as evidenced by detecting CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of ambulatory process of care as a predictor of health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease is associated with smaller declines in SF-12 physical component scores."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The study developed a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese adults, which is applicable to a BMI greater than 23, and has a high accuracy rate. The Singapore equation reached an accuracy rate of 80%."}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, physician-examiners can participate from a distance in an objective structured clinical examination, as evidenced by significant correlations between LEs and REs across reOSCE stations."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) is a significant prognostic factor for adverse maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in women with suspected preeclampsia. A 1-unit increase in the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio is associated with an increased odds of adverse maternal and neonatal composite outcomes, and with reduced gestational age at delivery."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in venous air embolism risk between the head-down and 20 degrees head-down positions during liver surgery."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that arsenic exposure may have an effect on diabetes mellitus in Swedish art glass workers, particularly in combination with cardiovascular disease. The risk is higher for those with high exposure."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current readiness guidelines for hospital preparedness for multiple casualty incidents may not be sufficient to predict the severity of the attacks. The study also suggests that the number of casualties may be higher in some cases."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease, with a significant proportion of patients receiving eradication therapy. However, the majority of patients with a definitive diagnosis received therapy."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read, as evidenced by improved word reading and improved verbal memory skills. However, phonological awareness levels are also significantly correlated with word reading."}

{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis can be achieved by duplex Doppler ultrasonography, as evidenced by the high accuracy and sensitivity of the indices HARI, SI, and SPI."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), as evidenced by a lower rate of interleukin-6 and IL-1 alpha levels, higher mean levels of lactate, and higher mean levels of IL-1 alpha and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. However, the mean lactate levels were higher for RRP at T1, T2, T3, and T4 compared to RRP."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that skin care frequency may have a significant impact on the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients. The moderate IAD group had a lower dermatitis score compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control, as evidenced by a significant reduction in pain disparities in minority patients."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Insulin resistance is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly in middle-aged individuals without diabetes. However, the association between fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity, and body fat percentage is non-significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity and body fat percentage."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia is a useful tool for reducing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment. However, it is important to note that the study did not find any significant complications or anomalies during the procedure."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The 2009 TNM version of the TNM staging system for primary tumor classification in kidney cancer is not a perfect solution, but it provides valuable information for the validation of the TNM version in a large cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma. The study did not find a significant independent predictive role for cancer-specific survival in patients with pT2b and pT3a tumors. However, the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of cancer-specific survival in patients with pT3c and pT4 tumors. The substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role. The major limitations of the study include retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and the small number of"}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system does not predict mortality, transfusion requirements, or non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. However, it can predict head, chest, or abdomen injuries, and can predict transfusion requirements."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parity increases insulin resistance during pregnancy, as evidenced by a decrease in insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and an increase in insulin resistance (2-h AUC glucose) in women with parity>3 and GDM."}

{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that women have a higher recanalization rate and poorer 3-month outcomes after intravenous (rt-PA) treatment compared to men. However, the study did not find a significant difference in recanalization rate, time to recanalization, or clinical outcome between men and women."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum samples can be used for analyzing EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The correlation between EGFR mutations detected in tumor samples and EGFR mutations in serum samples is significant, with a correlation index of 0.62."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Web-based systems are a significant factor in the uptake and use of medical oncology protocols, with varying levels of education and experience."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, being small for gestational age is a significant risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity, particularly in those born small for gestational age. The prevalence of any stage ROP and severe ROP is also significant."}

However, the association was not significant for atopy."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a short venous bypass in patients with critical leg ischemia may be an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia, as evidenced by a significant reduction in limb salvage rates and limb patency rates. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of this approach in patients with critical leg ischemia."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method can measure mesopic pupil size with a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting pupils larger than 6.0 mm."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study identified distinct patterns of atrophy in subjects with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 type, with the most pronounced atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe and posterior frontal lobe."}

{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the guidelines for assessing falls risk in patients at high falls risk for discharge home after rehabilitation are not sufficient for all cases. The study identified specific falls risk factors for specific risk factors, but did not identify specific strategies for all risk factors. The findings suggest that the guidelines for assessing falls risk in patients at high falls risk for discharge home after rehabilitation may not be sufficient for all cases."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that experts' recommendations for follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices are effective in improving the number of follow-up visits and improving the overall health of the Medicare population. However, the study also suggests that the number of follow-up visits may vary depending on the patient factors and year of implantation."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the CT attenuation values obtained with different CT scanners can differ significantly from one model to another, leading to significant overlaps between stone types. The t-paired test showed that most stone types could not be identified, while some types of stones presented mean CT attenuation values significantly different from one CT scanner to another."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis are more stable and less prone to corneal haze or breakthrough haze compared to conventional LASIK. However, both procedures still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Internet access and site use are significant factors in the development of sexual health awareness among young people, with a significant number of participants using a GUM website for information. However, the use of a GUM website for health information was not a significant factor in the development of sexual health awareness."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound is superior to X-ray for the detection of pediatric fractures, but X-ray is superior for dislocation identification."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Retention treatment for infected TKA is associated with lower infection control rates and shorter treatment duration compared to two-stage revision. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the number of additional procedures or length of hospital stay between the two treatment groups."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that unmarried pregnant women have a higher risk for certain bacterial vaginosis (BV) and selected bacterial flora, including Mycoplasma hominis, compared to married women. However, the independent risk factors for M. hominis were young age, low concentration of Lactobacillus spp., and a low concentration of Lactobacillus spp."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concept mapping enhances the learning outcome of nursing students by increasing the number of developed maps and increasing the number of developed maps developed during the eight sessions of intervention."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that human cytomegalovirus infection is associated with an increased risk of hypertension in women, but not in men."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhances quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients, as evidenced by a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve of 0.085. However, the ICUR for the treatment over FRC treatment was only 0.085."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol with various chemotherapeutic compounds can reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine follow-up procedures for endometrial cancer surveillance can lead to a significant reduction in the number of asymptomatic recurrences and a significant increase in the diagnostic path for local relapse. However, the study also suggests that the specific follow-up procedure may have a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic relapses."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the infundibular height of the lower pole calyceal stone after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy can predict the clearance of the stone. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant difference in height between the NR and R groups."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "The mortality rate in the treatment of Fournier's gangrene remains high, with a significant difference in leukocyte count between survivors and those who died. The risk factors and prognostic indicators for mortality include age, leukocyte count, hospital stay, and hospital stay duration."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the HTLV-I-infected individual may have a variant form of HAM/TSP, with inflammatory changes in the spinal cord and inflammatory markers in the CSF."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a higher staple line leak rate in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity."}
{"answers": "Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the content and presentation of participant information sheets can influence the recruitment and participation of pregnant women and trainee midwives for an antenatal intervention. The Double Awkward condition was found to be more complex than the Fluent and Awkward Title-Fluent Font conditions."}
{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "The majority of breast surgeons do not agree on acceptable margins for negative surgical margins in breast-conservation operations. The majority of surgeons would accept any negative margin, but only a small percentage would accept a 1-mm negative margin, a 2-mm negative margin, or a 5-mm negative margin."}
{"answers": "The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.", "prediction_text": "Acupuncture is effective in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions, as evidenced by significant improvements in vocal function, perceived quality of life, and structural changes in vocal fold lesions. However, the study did not find significant improvements in vocal function, perceived quality of life, or structural changes in vocal fold lesions in the sham acupuncture group."}
{"answers": "A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying \u226534 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.", "prediction_text": "The route of delivery in eclampsia is not a significant predictor of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with eclampsia."}

{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that epidural analgesia for labor is effective in achieving acceptable satisfaction levels for all women, with a high degree of satisfaction in the first trimester. However, it is important to note that the study did not find any maternal or fetal side effects."}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that family practice at residency teaching sites in northeast Ohio reflects community practice, with fewer diagnostic services and fewer preventive and therapeutic services offered. However, there were fewer consultations requested at our residency training sites."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphism is associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in response to hormone therapy, while one ESR2 gene haplotype is associated with total cholesterol and LDL-C in postmenopausal women."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "The presence of ankle/arm pressure is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that elderly individuals in Austria are adequately protected against infectious diseases, but their protection is not sufficient due to the lack of effective strategies for vaccination."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the introduction of a dedicated discharge coordinator resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of hospital discharge planning, including a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge, and in perceived need for medical and healthcare services."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that local anesthesia may not be necessary for the treatment of MRa of the shoulder, as pain levels were immediately assessed and no significant difference in pain intensity was detected between men and women. However, there was a significant difference in subjective pain perception between men and women."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay after clearance of common bile duct stones between patients with acute cholangitis undergoing endoscopic clearance of CBD stones and those who did not undergo endoscopic clearance. However, the procedure time was longer and the discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group than in the no-ENBD group."}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there is an association between nasal polyposis and the development of nasal polyps. However, further research is needed to confirm this association."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and real-time capsule endoscopy (CE) can be effective combined approaches in managing severe acute obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) in patients with overt OGIB, with a higher detection rate and better treatment outcomes. However, the combined approach requires a higher detection rate and better treatment outcomes compared to the traditional approach alone."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery for the indication of patient preference had significantly improved physical composite and mental composite scores, as well as improved gastricsymptom rating and reflux scores."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients are willing to participate in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia, with a significant number of patients expressing reluctance to allow students to conduct some or all aspects of the consultation independently. However, after the consultation, they reported they would have accepted higher levels of involvement than actually occurred."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obstructive sleep apnea patients exhibit increased aerobic fitness during cycle ergometry compared to a normal population."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives.

{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant association between the number of arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites and hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that family history of hyperlipidemia is not a reliable predictor of lipid levels in school children. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant correlation between family history and serum cholesterol levels."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of digoxin for cardiovascular disease is associated with a stronger reduction in the odds ratio of prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that growth hormone treatment reduces mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency, as indicated by a higher mortality rate in women and a lower mortality rate in men. However, the effect on malignancies was not significant."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, student examiners can be considered as reasonable substitutes for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, as they can provide more accurate and consistent assessments of examinee performance. However, the effect sizes reported in this study suggest that students may have a higher overall OSCE perception in the SE track compared to FE track."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that estrogen receptors in the anal canal may play a role in the development of anal incontinence, as indicated by the presence of estrogen receptors in smooth muscle cells and perimuscular connective tissue."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that women with mixed urinary incontinence experience greater improvement in the overactive bladder component of their symptoms after concomitant anterior/apical prolapse repair and musculoskeletal surgery compared to musculoskeletal surgery alone. However, the study did not find a significant difference in OAB symptoms between the two groups."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension.

{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "The scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes is a viable alternative for the management of undescended testicles, with a limited number of postoperative complications and a limited number of postoperative complications. However, it should be considered as a last resort option for patients with palpable undescended testicles."}

{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that ultrasound can be used as a diagnostic tool for determining megarectum and fecal load in constipated children, but it is important to note that the results may not be reproducible and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the optimal apical dose for treatment of posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru plaques is between 120 and 160 Gy, with a conservative approach leading to a better overall 5-year survival rate and a lower risk of retinopathy and macular degeneration. However, local control is important in some cases and the main side effects are mostly uncomplicated retinopathy and macular degeneration."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a pressor is necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest, as evidenced by increased aortic perfusion pressure and coronary perfusion pressures during infusion."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the overall desirability score of the manuscript was influenced by the presence of citations to the reviewer's work in the final regression model. The study also found that the number of reviewers recommending that authors add citations to the reviewer's work or other work was a confounder."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that nurse-led preoperative education significantly reduces anxiety and postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that decreasing length of stay for selected diagnostic categories, specifically AMI and bronchitis or asthma, is associated with an increased readmission rate and mean number of physician visits. However, no significant correlation was found between length of stay and mean number of physician visits for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four categories."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia compared to paired kidneys, as evidenced by a decrease in proinflammatory markers and increased expression of proinflammatory markers."}

We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours can decrease the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "Scintigraphy can be a useful tool for determining amputation levels in diabetic foot, as it can provide a more accurate and reliable assessment of amputation levels compared to traditional methods such as technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant mortality rate during the study period."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that socioeconomic status does not significantly impact quality of life in lung cancer patients, but physical mobility, energy, role functioning, and breathlessness are significant at baseline. However, there was no significant difference in quality of life between affluent and poor lung cancer patients at follow-up assessment."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair.

{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the implantation of kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients is not appropriate for all patients, as there were no significant differences in survival or renal function between the two groups. However, the study did find that the transplantation of kidneys from cadaver donors older than 60 years was associated with a higher survival rate."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "Patients with deficient comprehension of emergency department care and instructions are less likely to perceive their own understanding as being deficient. However, patients with comprehension deficits may still perceive their own understanding as lacking."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome (POD) or perioperative thyroid function between patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and normothermic (n = 6) CPB."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that severe hypoglycaemia was associated with an increased risk for both primary and arrhythmic cardiovascular events, as well as a greater risk for the primary outcome."}

Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy in portal hypertension is safe and effective, as indicated by a lower portal venous pressure and a lower morbidity rate compared to esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the recurrence rates between the EDWS and MED groups."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the intensity of postoperative pain can be predicted preoperatively, with a significant correlation between past history of pain, intensity, and duration of prior pain, triggering factors, and depression."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that general practice selection scores, specifically the AKT and CSA elements of the MRCGP, can predict success at the Royal College of General Practitioner examinations."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "Prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are distinct diseases, with prostate cancer presenting in the advanced stages and pleural effusion in the late stages."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients is necessary, as some reactions may require ICU management and may require further evaluation. However, the majority of cases did not require ICU management."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors can cause rebound aggravation of symptoms, as indicated by higher reflux, total, and antacid scores during the first treatment period."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The long-term results of the transanal endorectal pull-through are comparable to those of the transabdominal pull-through, with a higher continence score and better stool pattern score. However, the age at interview was not significantly influenced by the long-term outcome."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use among elderly people has increased over the last decade, with a higher prevalence of general practitioner visits and hospitalizations among older adults. The study found that men had a higher likelihood of being hospitalized and a higher likelihood of being hospitalized for chronic conditions, while women had a higher likelihood of being hospitalized for polypharmacy, and the number of general practitioner visits among women significantly increased from 2001 to 2009."}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, homemade alcohol (Raksi) can be useful for preserving dead bodies, as it contains alcohol and has preservative, bactericidal, and disinfectant properties."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The holmium:YAG laser lithotripter is a safe and effective option for ureteral stones, with a high success rate and a low failure rate. However, it is important to note that retropulsion of the stones can occur, and stenting is necessary for the successful treatment."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the grade of US-detected synovitis between patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those without treatment."}
