Older age and larger size were found to be significantly associated with neoplastic polyps in the study."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). The mutation, R14C, was identified in a family with a high prevalence of hypertension, and atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. The mutation increased current, leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration."}

The introduction and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly changed the natural history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related adverse effects, including mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future. The implementation of the new WHO recommendations will lead to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, including mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity is a factor in the rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse, with a high prevalence of fentanyl-related deaths observed in the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015."}

{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, hepatitis G virus and TT virus are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease. The study found that hepatitis G virus-RNA was detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis, and that at least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, mostly mutually exclusive) was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus liver disease. Additionally, the study found that hepatitis G virus-DNA was present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints are a stronger predictor of subsequent symptoms of depression than income and age."}

{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the secular growth acceleration between contemporary fetal population and those from 35 years ago."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant association between prostate specific antigen and body mass index in men without prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "The study found that 30-day and 1-year mortality were significantly higher in patients who underwent emergency laparotomy compared to those who underwent normal laparotomy."}

This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low performance on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that students will fail a senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public's valuation of health care interventions is significantly lower than in contexts where the health care system is responsible for the safety of individuals, such as in the UK."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dose reduction to one parotid gland can prevent xerostomia in patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting.

We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay ward in a general and academic children's hospital is not effective in reducing the number of emergency calls, as it does not increase hospital efficiency, as it does not increase patient satisfaction, and it does not increase the rate of patient follow-up."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the outcome between patients who underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery and those who did not, with patients who achieved remission having a higher likelihood of achieving long-term remission compared to those who did not."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a single syndrome, with a higher number of patients undergoing diagnostic tests and hospital admissions compared to controls."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT.

{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "Yes, treatment as prevention (TasP) is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time, with a median duration of 14 years and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) in 47.8% of cases."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an etiologic role in the development of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The study found that the pyloric mucosa constitutes approximately one third of the cross-sectional diameter of the pyloric mass and fills and obstructs the pyloric canal, and that the mucosal thickness in infants with IHPS is approximately one third of the total thickness of the pyloric mass."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is predictable in newborns, with a higher proportion of false-positives and false-positive outcomes observed in infants with false-positives compared to those with true-negatives."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival.

{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a high correlation was found between the diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) and histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors, including pleomorphic adenomas, myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "Yes, UK radiologists are satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with a significant proportion of respondents (25%) saying that the service could be improved."}

{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that behavioural risk factors such as smoking, alcohol intake, and HIV infection are to blame for the conversion from optimal blood pressure (BP) to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The Web-based sample was found to be more likely to have higher self-reported physical and psychological symptoms compared to the clinic sample, and the Web-based sample was less likely to have worse physical symptom burden compared to the clinic sample."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, with a contact surface of 0.83 mm and a sagittal rotation of 1.3\u00b0 at 1 year postoperatively."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life.

{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, peer review is a useful tool for assessing quality of care in chronic disease settings, as it can provide a more reliable estimate of the quality of care compared to structured implicit chart review."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failed IUD insertions are an under-recognized problem in community practice, with a higher rate of unsuccessful insertions among nulliparous women compared to parous women."}

The study found that p53 protein accumulation was found in 40% of rectal tumors, p53 gene mutation in 35% and p53 alteration in 46%. The average reduction in tumor size was 53% in the group with wild-type p53 and 63% in the group with altered p53. No significant differences in tumour size reduction or local failure were observed in the groups with p53 overexpression or p53 mutation compared to normal."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) may be an effective treatment for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in patients with advanced disease, as it significantly improved mortality and morbidity outcomes compared to surgical excision and antibiotics alone."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients treated with higher doses of zonisamide (ZNS) are more likely to have good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs, and have a better tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs compared to those treated with lower doses."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC)."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can substitute for arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee, as shown by the study's findings of 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries, as well as the associated bone and cartilage damage."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population.

EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery or radiation therapy significantly improves survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers (EPSCC) in multivariate analysis, with surgery and/or radiation therapy being independent predictors of survival."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) is related to pylorus preservation, with a higher incidence of DGE observed in patients who underwent the retrocolic duodenojejunostomy (DGE) antecolically compared to those who underwent the antecolic duodenojejunostomy (DGE) without the retrocolic duodenojejunostomy (DGE)."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP)."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that c-kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target. The expression of c-kit in cultured uveal melanoma cells was found to be strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated, suggesting that c-kit plays a role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic.

{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "No, staging laparoscopy (SL) is not useful for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study found that SL was unsuccessful in detecting unresectable tumors in the contralateral lobe of the liver, leading to the loss of valuable time and money. Additionally, the biopsy of the contralateral liver was not performed for 45 patients who underwent SL, leading to changes in management for 4 patients (17 %)."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that inter-observer agreement was high for the main pathologic features of DCIS, including the main pathologic features of ductal carcinoma, and that secondary pathology assessments lead to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 100% of cases."}

{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, D-dimer levels can become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis, as lower levels of D-dimer are associated with lower rates of acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study found that the number of perforations in the window stage leaves of A. madagascariensis was significantly lower compared to controls, and that the mitochondria showed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes.

{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene is a candidate for schizophrenia, as it has been shown to have different expression levels in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is clinically relevant, with better results in prognosticating 1-year independent ambulation compared to the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, including larger decreases in whole brain volume, lateral ventricular volume, and larger increases in bilateral lateral ventricular volume."}

{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, context matters for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The study found that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models, and that the relationship does not vary between regions in any of the models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relationship does not vary between regions in any of the models."}
