{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer is associated with a significant decrease in overall survival, but also with a higher risk of cancer-related death. The study also suggests that the use of a chemotherapy protocol may increase the risk of tumor progression."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that delayed phase imaging series can provide additional benefits in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, particularly in cases where findings are incidental or observed only in the delayed phase. However, the study also suggests that the added radiation dose and time required for delayed phase imaging series may not be justified for most cases."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive subscale can identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors, particularly depression and anxiety. The study found that symptoms of depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, while symptoms of anxiety contributed an additional 6% (P<.0001)."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "The decision to discontinue treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with e-antigen negative chronic hepatitis B is often based on the absence of virologic relapse, but the study did not find a significant difference in the rate of virologic relapse between patients with and without virologic relapse. The study also did not find a significant difference in the mean treatment duration between the two groups. However, the sustained response group had a higher mean age and longer treatment duration than patients with virologic relapse but these differences were not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant correlation between the diameter of the aortic aneurysm and the atmospheric pressure on the day of rupture. However, a trend towards a higher rate of rupture in larger aneurysms was observed in cases where the atmospheric pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was particularly pronounced in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The sternal skin conductance (SSC) device is a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement, with a concordance rate of 24% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. However, further research is needed to establish a definitive standard for the device."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral hip fracture, but it is not cost-effective for most analyses. The success of prophylactic fixation is highly sensitive to the effectiveness and relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pre-residency selection criteria such as USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores, MCAT scores, number of clinical honors, and AOA membership have a moderate to weak correlation with objective measures of resident knowledge and performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. Pre-residency selection criteria such as global evaluation scores and faculty rankings also have a weak correlation with objective measures. However, subjective ratings by faculty have a strong correlation with both objective measures and subjective ratings."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment can predict a higher pregnancy rate and cancellation rate in IVF patients, but it does not provide additional information beyond age and FSH levels. The cancellation rate is also higher in IVF patients with antral follicle>6."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in survival between residents who received a feeding tube and those who did not after adjusting for selection bias. However, the timing of PEG tube insertion did influence survival."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early discharge with nurse home visits is associated with a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate and repeat specimens when the initial specimen is inadequate, as well as a higher rate of initial specimen being inadequate within the first 9 days of life."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that high-dose radiotherapy may not be superior to palliative treatment in terms of overall survival in patients with lung cancer. However, the subgroup analysis suggests that patients with a good-fair overall condition may benefit from high-dose radiotherapy."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in leukocyte counts and CRP values between patients with acute appendicitis and those with uninflamed appendix in elderly patients. However, the study did find that patients with acute appendicitis had a higher percentage of patients with both values elevated compared to those with uninflamed appendix."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane does not significantly alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery, as shown by unchanged end-tidal concentration, heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change, and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening. However, it does increase end-systolic wall-stress and end-systolic wall-stress gradient."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that adult patients with celiac disease who have developed tolerance to gluten may still have symptoms and signs of celiac disease, but they may not be able to tolerate gluten completely. The majority of patients continued to consume gluten, but some developed tolerance to gluten and experienced symptoms and signs of celiac disease."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers in South Africa are not appropriate for the South African context due to significant differences in nutritional adequacy, cost, and preparation times. The study suggests that commercial formula may provide adequate amounts of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine, but requires longer preparation times and costs approximately 32% of monthly income. The study also suggests that PM and FM prepared with UNICEF micronutrient supplements provide adequate amounts of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine, but require longer preparation times and costs approximately 20% of monthly income"}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the use of inhaled corticosteroids can negatively impact the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients, as indicated by a negative association between eosinophil counts and PD. However, the study also suggests that the effect of eosinophilic inflammation on PD may be reversed by inhaled corticosteroids."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that older people with high financial assets may be more likely to accept preventive home visits, but the association is attenuated when adjusted for municipality invitational procedures. However, the association is still significant for older people with low financial assets."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between circulating androgens and sexual desire in women. However, a correlation was found between serum levels of androstenedione and sexual desire in women aged 25-44 years."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that comorbidity of major depression and alcohol use disorder in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes, including higher rates of depression and depression-related disorders, in adulthood. However, the study did not find a significant difference in rates of depression between the major depression and alcohol use disorder groups. The factors that explained the associations were gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find statistically significant differences in target motion between superior and inferior portions of the prostate bed using RTOG consensus definitions and daily CT-on-rails imaging. However, there was a trend towards greater target motion in the superior portion of the prostate bed in the superoinferior and anteroposterior directions."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians are at high risk for carotid endarterectomy due to their high risk for stroke and perioperative morbidity and mortality."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine in combination can result in synergistic suppression of T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens in mice. The synergy is observed in both an alloreactive and an alloreactive response."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Exercise training can lead to a reduction in heart rate variability and QT interval, but the effect is more pronounced in women."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "The presence of base deficit on admission is a significant predictor of mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, but there is no significant difference in mean base deficit between survivors and non survivors."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that infants with syncope during bathing may have an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria, a condition characterized by similar symptoms and signs but with a higher incidence of blood histamine levels. However, the evolution of these conditions is not favorable after a few weeks without baths."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may lead to an increase in peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as indicated by an increase in beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels. However, no significant elevation of serum ALP was observed in the study population."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan can lead to significant changes in the estimates of associations between sleep and energy problems and socio-demographic and life-style factors. However, the CHOPIT model provides more nuanced results."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries. Additionally, there is a higher conversion rate in men and longer operating time in men."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "Fluoroscopy is essential for successful retrieval of lower ureteric stones, but it is not essential for the safe retrieval of stones with calcified strictures, duplex system, narrow and tortuous meatus, or for confirmation of spontaneous passage. Fluoroscopy can be used for dilation of the ureteric balloon and double-J stenting in cases of mucosal ulceration, polypoid reaction, and perforation."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, injury severity surrogates, such as length of stay in the intensive care unit, non-ICU LOS, and the use of external radiation beam therapy, are significantly associated with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification in acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis can be associated with a risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis, and epidural abscess. The use of a continuous epidural infusion of ropivacain during the procedure can help reduce the risk of these complications."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that telemonitoring/teleconsultation may improve glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes patients, but the improvement is not consistent across all subgroups. The study also suggests that the benefit of telemonitoring/teleconsultation may vary depending on the type of diabetes and the individual patient. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to assess the clinical significance of telemonitoring/teleconsultation in type 1 diabetes patients."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the attendance rate and invasive screen detection rates of the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program in Sami speaking municipalities are lower than in the non-Sami population, but the difference is not statistically significant. The difference in invasive screen detection rates between the two groups is also not statistically significant. The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among Sami is lower than in the non-Sami population, but this difference is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "Ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure is associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence, but it does not appear to be beneficial for long-term stable sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that serum pancreatic lipase can improve the diagnostic accuracy of serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase. However, it is important to note that this study was conducted in a single center and further research is needed to confirm these findings in larger patient populations."}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy using a flexible endoscope is a feasible and effective method for performing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in pigs. The procedure is safe and effective in terms of visualization and ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the systolic blood pressure difference between the two arms of the vertebral artery waveform can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome, with a significant difference being observed in the complete reversal and alternating groups."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Transcranial direct current stimulation can be used to differentiate unresponsive wakefulness syndrome patients from minimally conscious state patients, as it can boost cortical connectivity and excitability in both groups, but it can also reveal residual networks in some UWS patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease, but they differ in their acceptability of certain factors, such as the severity of the disease, time taken to discuss it with the patient, intent to inform the spouse, and intent to adopt protective behaviours. The decision to consult an expert in STDs is a significant factor in the acceptability of the practice."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students in a 4(th)-year emergency medicine clerkship have met the recommended core conditions for encountering selected core conditions, including chest pain, abdominal pain, and cardiac arrest. However, the study also reports that students did not always see all conditions, and some students did not even see all conditions during their rotation."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "The presence of bile duct sludge is associated with an increased risk of recurrent common bile duct stones, but it is not a definitive predictor of gallbladder stones. Other risk factors such as common bile duct dilation, age, previous open cholecystectomy, and bile duct angulation do not differ between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the incidence of staple line leaks between patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and those who did not. However, the study did find that patients in the decompression group had a longer hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) can be a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, with a high sensitivity for hepatic metastases and a low specificity for nodal metastases. However, it has a low sensitivity for diagnosing nodal metastases. Therapeutic decisions should be based on the results of preoperative staging and laparoscopy."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, as it is not a diagnosis of exclusion for all patients with IBS. However, clinicians should consider other diagnoses, such as celiac sprue screening and complete blood count, in addition to IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and the length of aganglionosis in Hirschsprung's disease is moderate, with a Kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.39. However, the correlation is not perfect, as some cases may have a high agreement but some cases may have a low agreement. The correlation is not perfect for all types of aganglionosis, but it is generally good for the length of aganglionosis."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "The presence of signs of spinal cord involvement, such as pyramidal tract sign, is associated with a poorer recovery at the final follow-up in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that low-tone sudden deafness may not necessarily progress to Meniere's disease, but the risk is higher in patients with recurrent episodes and high-tone sudden deafness. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the rate of progression between low-tone and high-tone sudden deafness groups."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in hypertensive patients. The DD genotype of ACE-1 gene is associated with an increased risk for CKD."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "The majority of cases of age-related macular degeneration with visual loss are not permanent, but can be reversed with treatment. The improvement in visual acuity can be transient and can be sustained for up to 12 months."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, quantitative real-time PCR can be used to detect BCRABL transcripts in clinical specimens, with a strong correlation observed between results obtained at both laboratories. However, the correlation coefficient was 0.9435 (p<0.00001), indicating a moderate correlation."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Spinal subdural hematomas can occur following subarachnoid hemorrhage, and they can be associated with neurologic symptoms such as lower back and buttock pain. The patient in this case report had a successful resolution of her pain and neurological symptoms following treatment with urokinase, fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid evacuation. However, the patient did experience some neurologic symptoms, including lower back and buttock pain, but they were resolved within a few weeks. The patient was discharged after a brief period of observation."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the LAA occlusion device does not significantly alter echocardiographic parameters, but it may lead to a larger left atrial diameter during follow-up visits. However, the study did not find significant differences in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that untethering patients with myelomeningocele prior to scoliosis correction surgery is not necessary, as all patients had been radiographically tethered and had no evidence of neurological or neurological complications."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Pulp chamber pulpotomy is a temporary treatment option for pulpal necrosis and pain in teeth with vital pulps, but it is not a permanent treatment option for all cases. The decision to treat with pulpotomy should be based on individual patient factors and the extent of the necrosis and pain."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "Endovenous laser ablation of small saphenous varicose veins can lead to significant improvement in venous clinical severity scores, quality of life, and patient satisfaction, with no significant difference in complications and recurrence rates between the mid-calf and lower-calf groups."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "The presence of retinal haemorrhages following convulsions is not a definitive indication for further investigation. However, further investigation is necessary to rule out other causes."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "The Pathway program has influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations, as evidenced by a statistically significant difference in student confidence ratings and qualitative findings."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that approximately one-third of colorectal cancers are due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopy. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the size of the tumour between the three groups of patients."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention, with effects on early processing stages (200-500 ms) and later processing stages (>500 ms) being additive."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Second pancreas transplantation is a safe and effective option for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft, with better second pancreas survival and better kidney graft function and survival compared to first pancreas transplantation. However, it does not significantly impact kidney graft function or survival."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, hospitals on weekends experience significantly lower quality care, including delayed treatment, higher rates of adverse health outcomes, and higher rates of readmission and mortality."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "The presence of viral co-infection in children with acute respiratory infections is associated with increased severity, longer hospital length of stay, higher clinical scores, and higher rates of pneumococcal vaccination. However, the association with bacterial superinfection is less clear."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, delayed appendectomy timing is associated with an increased risk of perforation and postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. Age \u226555 years is a significant predictor for both perforation and postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between fetal gender and emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy. However, a higher risk of having an emergency department visit for asthma was observed among women with a fetal gender of 1. However, the risk was not significantly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma ED visit during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with rotator cuff tears were more likely to be working in occupations with a higher occupational load, such as agriculture and forestry, and in the building industry."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that the zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate in the neonatal intensive care unit has been significantly reduced over a 5-year period, and this reduction is sustainable for at least 1 year. The implementation of evidence-based measures, including bundles and checklists, led to a significant reduction in CLABSI rates. The study also identified key determinants of success, including ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices, and improved documentation."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "The use of atropine in ketamine sedation is associated with a higher incidence of hypersalivation, transient rash, vomiting, and better tolerance. However, there is a risk of side effects such as transient rash and vomiting during recovery."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation are not equivalent concepts, with wandering being associated with physically aggressive behaviors and PNA being associated with physically nonaggressive behaviors."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of an advance care planning model in community palliative care services was feasible, with staff and clients engaging in advance care planning conversations and implementing the model in practice. The model was effective in improving communication and communication skills, and was adapted and applied by the services. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model into routine practice."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies can migrate through the body, leading to extra-lumen migration, which can lead to extra-lumen migration and extra-lumen migration to the heart. The mechanisms involved in this process are complex and involve both internal and external factors. The risk to the patient is high, as the foreign body can migrate to the heart and can lead to complications such as esophageal stenosis, pharyngeal stenosis, and pharyngeal stenosis."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that players do not believe that headgear can prevent concussion, but that a significant number of players do wear headgear and feel that its use should be mandatory. The common reasons for not wearing headgear were \"its use is not mandatory\", \"it is uncomfortable\", and \"costs too much\"."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that early postoperative oral intake may be possible in some patients after laparoscopic surgery, but the rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion was not significantly different between the two groups. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the duration of postoperative ileus between the two groups. Further research is needed to determine the optimal timing for early oral intake after laparoscopic surgery."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the present study suggests that failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction are associated with a higher posterior tibial slope, which is a risk factor for ACL injury."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that elderly patients do not accurately endorse the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of acute stroke, particularly in the case of symptoms such as Amaurosis Fugax."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Routine chest radiography following transbronchial biopsy is not necessary for the detection of pneumothorax, as it is not a common complication. However, it is important to note that symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax may be present in patients who do not develop symptoms after the procedure."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Early surfactant administration is associated with a lower rate of chronic lung disease and mortality in preterm infants, but late surfactant administration is associated with a higher rate of mortality. However, the impact on chronic lung disease or major neonatal morbidities is minimal."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, people who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood have an increased risk of long-term work disability, particularly for those with neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that changing the thickness of double-oblique images can improve mandibular depiction, but the results were not statistically significant. However, the results suggest that the choice of thickness may depend on the specific imaging conditions. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Chemoradiation is a safe and effective treatment option for mid and low rectal tumors, with a high 5-year overall survival rate of 60.5%. However, it is important to note that local recurrence and perineural invasion are common complications."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can improve the predictive ability of risk models in conjunction with clinical assessment by reducing the number of clinical/demographic variables required for model construction."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that continuation of insulin 30/70 twice daily and bedtime isophane in type 2 diabetes patients with uncontrolled disease does not result in improved glycemic control or greater satisfaction with treatment. However, patients in the insulin monotherapy group had fewer treatment failures and less weight gain compared to those in the insulin in addition to metformin group."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as shown by its high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy, and a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when its D2 occupancy exceeds 80%."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the infusion of low-concentration epinephrine during pregnancy can impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, as evidenced by a decrease in uterine blood flow to 68% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that increased neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This finding suggests that interleukin-8 plays a role in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils to the lung, contributing to the development of ARDS."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) can be used as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease, but its diagnostic sensitivity is low. The study suggests that MP-SPECT may be a useful alternative for detecting AD patients with significant reductions in rCBF. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a definitive diagnostic threshold."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Double-balloon enteroscopy is an effective method for diagnosing small-bowel disorders, with a diagnostic yield of 75% and therapeutic yield of 63.6%. However, it is important to note that it is not a definitive diagnostic tool and further research is needed to establish a definitive diagnostic algorithm."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis for patients with acute myocardial infarction, but it is associated with higher patient satisfaction and convenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation is positively correlated with the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot is associated with increased right ventricular end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume, but not end-systolic volume or end-diastolic volume at the time of surgery. The optimal timing for surgery depends on the individual patient."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the conversion rate to modified radical mastoidectomy, but it is important to note that conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy may require a third-look procedure."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) has had a significant impact on the quality of mammography in North Carolina, as evidenced by an increase in mammography facilities meeting quality standards and a decrease in phantom image evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of health information exchange (HIE) in emergency departments (EDs) has been associated with reductions in repeat imaging, specifically in CT, ultrasound, and chest x-ray imaging, as well as a decrease in the probability of repeat imaging."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that gestational age misclassification plays a role in the difference in birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites, but the effect is less pronounced for extreme misclassification."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (w-d) is clinically early cancer, as it has lower incidences of fibrous capsule formation, intrahepatic metastasis, and portal vein invasion compared to less differentiated HCCs. However, the histological analysis did not reveal significant differences in disease-free survival between the two groups. The presence of minute cancerous foci in the tumor was also noted in the resected specimen."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the occurrence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages in the night-time is associated with a higher risk of recurrence."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that black patients had a higher prevalence of underestimation of asthma severity compared to white patients. This association was more pronounced among black patients with poorer asthma care and communication."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results are often not consistent in reporting intact hCG results. The results may be incorrect due to errors in the immunoassay method used."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections does not significantly impact the practice of surgeons. However, the use of the summary of current evidence in the mailings did lead to a significant increase in prophylactic NG use in the second group."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that apoptosis may not be the primary cause of neuronal death in mesial temporal sclerosis. Instead, other factors may contribute to neuronal loss."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Golytely is associated with a higher rate of adenoma detection compared to MiraLAX. The difference in adenoma detection rate between the two preparations is significant (26.2% vs. 16.1%, P = 0.091)."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not predict the neoplastic nature of the polyp, but older age and large size are significant predictors."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, may be linked to both genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. The mutation results in an increase in stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 currents, which may contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a real-time PCR approach for the identification and quantification of allergenic pollen taxa, which can be used for aerobiological monitoring. The study demonstrates the accuracy of the method, with good-quality DNA obtained from pollen samples."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "The Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator both provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10\u2005kg weight, but the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator exhibits serious elevated positive end expiratory pressure and cannot reliably achieve set peak pressures."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, menopausal transition is associated with an adverse impact on the quality of life in middle-aged women, as indicated by a deterioration in vitality."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that confined placental mosaicism is less common in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared to spontaneous conceptions, but it is still a significant risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, as it shows a significant difference in predicted and observed mortality rates between survivors and patients who died on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10. However, it is important to note that the APACHE II score itself does not provide a definitive diagnosis of physiological impairment, but rather a simple measure of impairment. The APACHE II score can be used to assess the severity of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this systematic review suggest that perforation of the appendix is associated with an increased risk of tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy. However, the risk is not a direct cause of infertility or ectopic pregnancy. The risk is likely to be influenced by confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and medical history."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, trabecular bone is related to primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone blocks of different bone mineral densities. The study found that trabecular number, trabecular thickness, bone volume density, and trabecular BMD were correlated with primary stability."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "The study identified several factors that may contribute to non-adherence in tuberculosis patients, including the presence of family members and paying monthly service expenses, as well as the presence of supervised treatment visits. However, the study also identified that patients who were observed by family members and paid monthly service expenses above 450 RMB were more likely to be non-adherent."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Yes, induction chemotherapy can improve the outcomes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma by reducing local failure and distant failure, but it does not have a significant impact on overall survival. The choice of treatment depends on the stage of disease and the patient's individual circumstances."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of both VEGF and TGF-\u03b21, with a significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and the expression of both factors."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fragile esophageal mucosa, a sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis, can be used as a diagnostic tool for endoscopy in cases of dysphagia."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative platelet count is an independent prognostic factor for better 5-year survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. Patients with a platelet count \u2264 205 have a significantly better 5-year survival than those with a platelet count >205."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the age at orchiopexy significantly affects testicular survival, with orchiopexy at older ages being associated with increased risk of testicular atrophy."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that shorter duration of psychological treatment for depression is associated with a higher likelihood of return into treatment. However, the study also suggests that return into treatment may be influenced by other factors such as demographic and clinical factors. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential impact of other factors such as depression severity and treatment duration on return into treatment."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a written information sheet can significantly improve recall of the consent interview for total hip arthroplasty patients."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in muscle strength and physical performance between bicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty patients at any time point. However, the TKA group showed improvement in physical performance in the 6-min walk test."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant effect of T-cell deficiency on spatial learning ability following toluene exposure in mice. However, nude mice exposed to toluene showed poor retention memory in the probe trial."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa is a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children, as it is observed in a significant number of endoscopies. The presence of VLEM is associated with significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in noise levels between high flow nasal cannulae and bubble CPAP for preterm infants. However, there was a trend towards noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth is a significant predictor of risk for recurrent preterm birth. Advanced cervical dilatation is associated with a higher risk for recurrent preterm birth, while preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor are associated with a lower risk."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease of bone is common in India, with a mean age of 49.2 years and male to female ratio of 2.5:1. The most common clinical manifestations include backache, headache, bone pains, fracture, joint pain, deafness, gait ataxia, visual impairment, and difficulty in biting. The disease is most commonly located on the skull and spine. The serum alkaline phosphatase levels decrease after treatment with bisphosphonates."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector CT is not significantly different from that of other pathologies such as lymphadenopathy greater than a short-axis diameter of 5 mm, discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening. However, it is important to note that obese patients may have a higher prevalence of misty mesentery compared to overweight patients."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid during percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules is not associated with a greater success rate or complication rate compared to non-aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid. However, the total procedure time is significantly longer due to additional procedures."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there are significant correlations between disease activity and damage in SLE patients, with increased disease activity and reduced physical function being correlated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations. However, age and disease duration did not show significant correlations with health status in this study."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the clinical course of intra-abdominal desmoids between patients with ileorectal anastomosis and those with ileorectal proctocolectomy. However, the study did find that patients with ileorectal anastomosis had a higher risk of complications, including bleeding, fistula, bowel obstruction, pain, and death related to desmoids."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high-IQ schizophrenia patients exhibit distinct symptom profiles, including higher levels of negative symptoms and disorganised symptoms, as well as better global functioning and insight. These patients also exhibit a minimal post-onset decline in intelligence."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of betamethasone in aminoglycoside-containing ear drops can reduce cochlear toxicity, as evidenced by a decrease in auditory brainstem response thresholds and no significant additional hearing loss."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "The use of fetal anatomic assessments on follow-up antepartum sonograms can lead to an increased incidence of unexpected fetal anomalies, particularly in those with a higher rate of neonatal interventions."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, molecular genotype can provide valuable information in the management of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers, as it can identify specific molecular mechanisms that contribute to the disease progression and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The study suggests that BRAF mutations are associated with poorer progression-free survival and that PDTC histologic subtype is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival."}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "The extent of lymphadenectomy can be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer, as shown by a decrease in lymph node metastasis incidence and metastatic rates in the NACT-responsive group. However, deep stromal invasion and lymph vascular invasion, but not response to chemotherapy, are independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in node-positive patients. The number of lymph nodes involved, response to chemotherapy, tumor histology, and a positive vaginal margin are independent prognostic factors affecting DFS or OS rates in node-positive patients."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prior benign prostate biopsies are associated with improved biochemical disease-free survival in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy for prostate cancer. However, the study also suggests that patients with prior benign biopsies have a lower probability of biochemical failure."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that remote postischemic conditioning may protect against ischemic damage in percutaneous coronary intervention, as indicated by a lower rate of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality in the remote postischemic group. However, the study did not find a significant difference in myocardial infarction or cardiovascular mortality between the two groups."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, edaravone, a selective inhibitor of caspase-3, attenuates ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats, as evidenced by a decrease in ovarian degeneration and edema, and a reduction in caspase-3 expression."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasonography can be a useful tool for detecting undescended testis in boys, but it can miss some structures, such as the abdominal testes and other structures. The clinical examination and surgical findings should be considered in cases of no palpable testis."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that mammographic density does not significantly impact the re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery, but it does correlate with the extent of resection of unnecessary margins during initial breast-conserving surgery. However, the correlation between mammographic density and re-excision rates was not significant in the multivariable analysis."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty may be an effective alternative to nasal packing, as it results in fewer complications and shorter operating time. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that ultrasound may not be a reliable diagnostic tool for detecting internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint, as it has lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging. However, it can provide valuable information on the presence of articular sounds and signs."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that serum leptin levels are significantly lower in advanced lung cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. However, there is no significant difference in leptin levels related to clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, disease stage, and TNM classification. The correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI was also found to be significant in lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae between patients with and without a repeat infection."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, viral infections, specifically herpes zoster, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus, have been identified as potential risk factors for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain cytokines, specifically IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta, may have a role in the development of epilepsy, but the correlation between cytokines and seizure types was not significant. However, there was a decrease in cytokine levels during the seizure-free period in patients with epilepsy."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas by reducing insulin secretion and stimulating somatostatin secretion at both physiological and supraphysiological glucose concentrations."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding does not significantly impact reoperation rates. However, patients with fewer sutures have shorter OR times and longer LOS."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate patients with intracerebral hemorrhage is influenced by both their history of intracerebral hemorrhage and the risk of thromboembolic stroke. The decision to anticoagulate depends on the patient's individual circumstances and the clinical judgment of the treating physician. The decision to anticoagulate depends on the patient's risk of thromboembolic stroke and the risk of thromboembolic stroke in the presence of a history of intracerebral hemorrhage. The decision to anticoagulate can be influenced by the patient's individual circumstances and the clinical judgment of the treating physician."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that (18)F-FDG can be used as a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia, as shown by a decrease in similarity between FDG and (18)F-FDG images under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. However, the study also suggests that FDG may not be a reliable surrogate tracer for measuring tumor hypoxia under hypoxic conditions due to the presence of artifacts."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that treadmill training post stroke can lead to improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation, but no significant differences were found in depression, mobility, or social participation at the end of the study. However, improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation were observed in the treatment group."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus is a common cause of unsteadiness and gait impairment in neurodegenerative diseases, with a high prevalence and a wide range of clinical manifestations. It can be a significant contributor to gait impairment and unsteadiness in patients with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. The clinical manifestations can include leg jerking, gait disturbance, and gait impairment. The underlying neurological disorders can include multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. The treatment options for orthostatic myoclonus include antimyoclonic treatment, muscle relaxants, and muscle relaxants and anticonvulsants."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that trauma centers with a higher level of trauma center providing care have a higher risk of death and longer hospital stays for severely injured adult trauma patients. However, the association is not significant for continuous outcomes."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who become pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle, with some differences in expression levels among women who subsequently become pregnant."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "The new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO) has led to an increase in the incidence of ART-related adverse effects, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and the situation is likely to get worse in the near future. The WHO recommendations for ART initiation and adherence are not yet fully implemented in most SSA countries, and the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects are still not well understood. The implementation of the new policy will lead to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes, overt diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperlactatemia/lactateosis, and other adverse effects. The WHO recommends that countries implement strategies to mitigate these conditions, including the implementation of"}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that chest wall rigidity may play a role in the rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse. However, further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates, or severe OHSS rates between women with PCO who received metformin during IVF and those who received placebo. However, there was a trend towards increased live birth rates in the metformin group."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask ventilation protocol, with a greater percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range occurring when using the pediatric bag. However, the pediatric bag provides lower tidal volumes compared to the adult bag."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly impact the management of the patient, with no significant difference in the number of advanced adenomas detected or the number of advanced adenomas found in patients with or without colonoscopy. However, in some cases, advanced adenomas were found in advanced cases."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that cardiovascular evaluation during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas is not necessary for all patients, but it is essential for those with a family history of cardiovascular disease. The majority of patients reported no serious complications during beta-blocker therapy."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for type 2 diabetes, as it is effective in improving glycemic control and reducing the risk of complications in obese patients. However, it is important to note that the choice of surgical approach and patient selection are important considerations."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that ESC (Electronic Stability Control) may have a role in improving driver confidence in driving, but it is not a panacea and drivers may still experience behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC. The study also suggests that ESC may not be a panacea for all drivers, but it is a promising technology that could potentially improve driver safety."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Yes, clinical supervision is perceived to be effective by allied health professionals, as indicated by a positive correlation between length of supervision sessions and MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness. The three individual variables, namely receiving clinical supervision, having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor, and having a completed clinical supervision agreement, were also found to be significant predictors of MCSS-26 scores."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, social exclusion, specifically social exclusion based on economic and social factors, is negatively associated with suicide mortality in both sexes. The influence of economic and social factors is stronger in females."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound examination can be a useful addition to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, providing valuable information on the extent and invasion into the corpora. However, it is important to note that it is not a definitive diagnostic tool and further research is needed to establish its clinical utility."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, health care providers have a significant understanding of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers, but they are not proficient in the use of the device."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "The transverse apex of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is located at the coronal apex levels, but the most rotated vertebral levels are not always located at the same level as the coronal apex. The regional and global apex levels of the curve can differ significantly, with some curves having a higher variability."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)\" sample had a similar diagnostic profile to the \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" sample, with a higher prevalence of mania symptoms and ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality. However, the sample size was smaller than the \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" sample. The sample was also more likely to be from media and community sources."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "The study identified a broad consensus on the principles of good practice for health care for immigrants in Europe, but there still exists some disagreement within and between countries. The consensus was mainly based on the importance of easy and equal access to health care, empowerment of migrants, culturally sensitive health care services, quality of care, patient/health care provider communication, respect towards migrants, networking in and outside health services, targeted outreach activities, and availability of data about specificities in migrant health care and prevention."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex is present in cervical disk disease, as evidenced by its presence in the lavage fluid and its correlation with certain cytokines."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that affect-regulated exercise training can lead to improvements in physical health over a 8-week training program. The training group exercised at intensities that would be classified as being in the lower range of the recommended guidelines for cardiovascular health."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that hepatitis G virus and TT virus are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease, with hepatitis G virus-RNA and TT virus-DNA being detected in a significant proportion of cases. However, the presence of both viruses in the same patient was not always mutually exclusive. Severe liver damage was more common in subjects with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints, particularly in relation to depression symptoms, can significantly predict subsequent depressive symptoms in both men and women. However, it is important to note that this relationship is not linear, as other factors such as income and age also play a role."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Early predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome include sepsis syndrome, peak inspiratory pressure, and ventilation index values."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Inhibin, a circulating marker of hydatidiform mole, is significantly elevated in serum and tissue compared to normal women and can be used as a clinical marker for the condition. However, its concentration declines after evacuation, and its use in clinical practice is limited due to its suppression during the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The most suspect curve type in dynamic MRM is not necessarily the most reliable, but it provides additional information that can improve the diagnostic accuracy of the examination. The most suspicious curve types, such as those with a delayed time course of signal intensity, can provide additional information that can improve the diagnostic accuracy of the examination. The choice of curve type and its diagnostic accuracy should be based on individual patient characteristics and the specific MRM examination protocol."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination is the main reason for not using minimal access techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparous women are at significantly higher risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, and postpartum hemorrhage, compared to multiparous women of the same age."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with major depression in pregnancy are identifiable in population health data using both hospital admission records and dispensing claims records. However, the study suggests that the prevalence of depression in this population is around 16%."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients is not true for all time periods. The observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes is consistent with the expected distribution, but the observed distribution is not identical to the expected distribution."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that certain characteristics of a general practice, such as total list size, training status, and mean age of the GPs, were associated with variations in uptake and use of an IT innovation, the Managed Clinical Network, in diabetes care. However, none of the general practice variables were found to be associated with online use."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurses have a higher accuracy in predicting admission at triage compared to a simple objective score, but their predictive accuracy is not significantly better than that of a simple objective score. The study suggests that nurses may have a higher degree of clinical certainty, but their accuracy is not significantly better than that of a simple objective score."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin D deficiency is a significant feature of pediatric celiac disease, as shown by a higher 25(OH)D level in non-obese children compared to obese children. However, there is no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese and obese children in prepubertal children."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sulfasalazine can cause severe systemic reactions, including eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis, and myelotoxicity, in patients with Crohn's disease. The clinical course and management of this patient are presented."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that healthier lifestyles, such as exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and drinking habits, are associated with a lower utilization of healthcare resources."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a higher likelihood of being susceptible to smoking among middle school students."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "Yes, managed care programs have led to a greater number of low income persons having a usual source of care, but the likelihood of having a usual physician is less favorable. The study suggests that managed care may have a role in improving access to care for uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries, but the effect on the uninsured is less pronounced."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in the pain-relieving effect of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride compared to the control group in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy. However, there were some differences in other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia, and trismus between the two groups. The use of ropivacaine hydrochloride did not result in any significant complications."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that neochordal repair using artificial chords is a reproducible and effective approach for minimally invasive mitral valve repair, with a low rate of reoperations and a low rate of deaths. However, it is important to note that the study only included patients who underwent minimally invasive video-assisted mitral valve repair and did not directly compare the outcomes between the two approaches. Further research is needed to establish the applicability of this approach in routine surgery."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio can be used as a more accurate measure of valve size compared to the traditional method of measuring valve area. However, there is no significant difference in hemodynamic performance between the two bioprostheses in the aortic position."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction, with women delaying more than men and those who received advice to seek help or call 911 having longer delays. Additionally, women who received advice to seek help or call 911 had shorter delays compared to those who did not."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis is a forerunner to bronchiectasis, as shown by a significant reduction in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and an increase in IL-1\u03b2 levels in bronchiectasis and PBB groups."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy treatment can improve tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus, as evidenced by a significant decrease in tinnitus functional index scores and improvements in neck-bournemouth questionnaires. However, the effect was not sustained after six weeks follow-up."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was positively related to an increase in systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any statistically significant difference in the examined biometric parameters between contemporary and fetal population during the studied period. However, there was a trend towards a higher mean value in contemporary fetal population for certain biometric parameters, such as biparietal diameter and length, compared to those from 35 years ago."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between prostate specific antigen and body mass index in men without prostate cancer. However, a 10-point increase in body mass index was associated with a significant difference in prostate specific antigen."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that 30-day mortality is significantly higher in emergency general surgery laparotomies compared to other surgical procedures, particularly in those aged under 70 years. However, the study also suggests that 1-year mortality is higher in emergency general surgery laparotomies compared to other surgical procedures. The study also suggests that age-related mortality is higher in emergency general surgery laparotomies compared to other surgical procedures."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis has a potential causative link between the two conditions, as the child had a positive tuberculin interdermal reaction and had been treated for tuberculosis. However, further research is needed to confirm this association."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the development of vascularization on diffusion-weighted imaging between hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "The majority of patients do not want to call their doctors by their first names, but do not mind being called by their first names. However, some patients do not like being called by their doctors' first names."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ART patients face higher C-section rates during their delivery, with a higher risk for elective and emergency C-sections. The risk for significant perinatal bleeding is also higher in ART patients compared to other groups."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The use of unfractionated heparin and fractionated heparin in the treatment of trauma patients is associated with a higher risk of complications, including sudden drops in hemoglobin concentration, blood transfusion, and death. Other factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower initial platelet count, and lower initial platelet count may also contribute to complications."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the prevalence and treatment resource need of dental decay between new recruits to the British Armed Forces compared to those in the Royal Navy or Royal Air Force."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant differences in attentional bias between episodic migraineurs and non-migraine controls."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination, even when they perform well on a senior clinical examination. However, the predictive values for these scores are weaker than for USMLE Step 1 scores."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "The public's valuation of safety-related health care interventions is influenced by the system's responsibility, with interventions that are not directly responsible for the harms being valued more highly than those that are."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a dose reduction to one parotid gland may help prevent xerostomia in patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal dose reduction strategy."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily should continue to receive folic acid supplements for up to 9 months. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the incidence of toxicity between the two groups."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be performed safely and effectively in cases of residual fundus or neofundus development, with a low rate of complications and a high rate of weight loss. However, the study also suggests that fundectomy may be associated with complications, including bleeding, mid-gastric stenosis, and leaks. The use of fundectomy in cases of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease may lead to improved outcomes."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates that visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level can accurately reflect changes in visceral adipose tissue volume and body weight. The correlation between VAT area and VAT volume and body weight changes was strongest at a slice 3 cm above the lower margin of L3."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cytokeratin immunoreactivity can be a useful diagnostic tool for diagnosing short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 77.5%. However, the specificity of the test was lower than that of the gold standard, which was the histological diagnosis."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the lunar position significantly influences the time of delivery, with a higher lunar position leading to earlier delivery."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are cost-effective, as indicated by a higher incremental cost per quitter and a higher incremental cost per QALY gained. However, uncertainty remains in the expected value of perfect information. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to assess the potential impact on relapse rates and costs."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital can be effective in reducing length of stay, improving efficiency, and reducing unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. However, the use of the short stay or 23-hour ward may increase hospital costs due to increased bed usage and unscheduled visits. The short stay or 23-hour ward is a cost-effective solution for certain conditions, but it may not be effective for others."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease can lead to remission in approximately 80% of cases, but relapse can occur in up to 67% of cases. Factors such as early postoperative serum cortisol levels and histological findings can predict remission but not relapse. Complications include transitory diurnal circadian rhythm, transitory CSF leak, and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Chronic functional somatic symptoms are a significant group of patients with functional somatic symptoms in general practice, with distinct features such as functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, use of more somatic and psychotropic drugs, and visits to the GP more frequently. The presence of functional somatic symptoms in the general practice population is associated with a higher prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and a higher number of diagnostic tests."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The decision to refer a patient to a multidisciplinary team for breast cancer management is not always concordant, with a significant number of decisions being considered 'unjustifiable' or 'justifiable' based on patient choice, additional information available after the multidisciplinary team decision, or MDT error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK, as it is found in a significant proportion of isolates and is resistant to most antibiotics tested."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dogs can prime autistic children for therapy by providing structured activities with a therapist, who can observe their behavior and provide feedback. This approach can lead to improvements in positive behaviors and less frequent and shorter negative behaviors."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance, as indicated by lower levels of specific insulin and higher levels of des 31,32 proinsulin in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Postictal psychotic episodes are associated with an increased risk of developing interictal psychotic episodes, but the predictive value of these episodes is not perfect. The study suggests that other factors such as a history of PIPE and male gender may also contribute to the development of interictal psychotic episodes."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients with a high degree of accuracy (92.9% sensitivity and 98.2% specificity)."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery can increase the infection rate, particularly in patients who have undergone spinal surgery."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency medical services professionals (EMS professionals) have a significant number of opinions regarding participation in disease prevention programs, with a majority of responders reporting that they should participate in programs. The majority of responders reported providing prevention services during emergency calls, with a majority of responders reporting providing prevention services during emergency calls. However, not all responders reported providing prevention services during emergency calls. The most common demographic characteristics associated with participation in disease prevention programs were graduate degree, working for more than 21 years, working for the military, and working 60 to 69 hours per week. The most common demographic characteristics associated with providing prevention services during emergency calls were working for the military and working 60 to 69 hours per week."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that current guidelines for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients with ergocalciferol treatment are not adequate, as only a significant proportion of patients achieved adequate levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and iPTH levels."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pain intensity at admission is a significant predictor of opioid response in cancer patients, with patients with a good pain control response having higher pain intensity levels. However, the correlation between pain intensity and opioid response was not found in this study."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that maintaining HIV viral load suppression over time is feasible in resource-limited settings, with a high rate of virologic failure and a significant number of patients receiving third-line ART regimens."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis exhibit a significant amount of pyloric mucosal redundancy, which may contribute to the development of IHPS. The study suggests that pyloric mucosal redundancy may contribute to the development of IHPS through a relationship with the hypertrophied muscle layer."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes in newborns is predictable, with true-negatives being more likely to pass both tests and having a higher risk of adverse outcomes. However, false-positives were also associated with adverse outcomes, but the association was not significant. Factors such as antenatal care attendance, mode of delivery, and nursery type were also found to be useful predictors of discordance."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases is associated with improved disease-free survival and overall survival rates. However, it is important to note that the study also suggests that delayed liver resection may be more common in patients with synchronous liver metastases. The study also suggests that chemotherapy prior to liver surgery may be more common in patients with synchronous liver metastases. The study suggests that the use of chemotherapy prior to liver surgery may lead to a higher three-month mortality rate. However, overall survival rates were similar between the two groups."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a high correlation between echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging and histologic diagnosis of primary parotid gland tumors may not be a definitive predictor of histologic subtypes. However, the study also suggests that ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas may be different from those of other types of primary parotid gland tumors. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a definitive predictor of histologic subtypes."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The majority of radiologists in the UK do not have adequate training in suspected child abuse, and a significant number do not have ready access to paediatric radiology opinion. The majority of departments do not have a dedicated paediatric radiologist, and a significant number do not have adequate radiology and legal training. Expert evidence is not always provided by radiologists, and some departments do not have adequate radiology and legal training. The majority of radiologists do not consider providing expert evidence for suspected child abuse."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the changes in IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 levels in the serum may reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain behavioural risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol intake, and waist circumference, are independent predictors of hypertension in African individuals. However, other factors, such as central systolic and carotid cross-sectional wall area, also play a role in the development of hypertension."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The study found that both the Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV reported similar physical and psychological symptom burden, but the Web-based sample was more likely to be in paid employment and reported worse psychological symptom burden. The clinic sample was more likely to be in paid employment and reported better physical symptom burden. The study also found that employment status was significantly associated with physical symptom burden, but not psychological symptom burden."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups can provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, as demonstrated by a median proximal migration of 0.83 mm and sagittal rotation of 1.3\u00b0 at 1 year postoperatively. However, migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively was observed in some cases."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians can be associated with improved functional status and quality of life, but the mortality rate is high. The study also suggests that survivors may experience longer hospital stays and higher rates of mortality. However, the study also suggests that survivors may experience improvements in physical and mental health, as well as improved quality of life."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care, particularly in terms of total and healthcare-related deficiencies."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, open access endoscopy can significantly reduce the amount of information and explanation given to patients regarding procedures and the nature of the procedure, leading to a higher likelihood of patient satisfaction and a greater likelihood of endoscopic results being transferred to the patient."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, myomas can grow during pregnancy, but the volume of most myomas decreases during the first trimester and increases during the third trimester. The volume of most myomas in the last trimester is similar to that in the first trimester."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that socioeconomic factors, specifically low birth weight for gestational age, are associated with an increased risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood, while familial effects, such as a decrease in birth weight for gestational age, are more common in men born with appropriate birth weight for gestational age."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "The addition of a second reader to a double reading barium enema can improve the accuracy of the results, but the overall agreement between the readings is not perfect. The sensitivity for detecting adenocarcinomas decreases."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The VMPA approach to the temporomandibular joint can be a safe and effective alternative to traditional open procedures for achieving successful TMJ surgeries. The study demonstrates that patients who underwent TMJ surgeries through the VMPA had successful outcomes, with no reported cases of permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during primary lung cancer surgery is not necessary for all patients, but it is necessary for those with higher metastasis rates and pT stage. The study also suggests that the metastasis status of station 9 nodes does have a significant influence on survival. However, the study does not provide definitive answers on the necessity of dissection of station 9 lymph nodes for all patients."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The FDA warning on antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims did not significantly impact the trend in AED prescription claims over the study period. However, no significant change in trend was detected in the subgroup of epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder patients."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study found that self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors was more accurate than government records in identifying more accidents and convictions in the 5 years before study entry. However, the difference was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study describes a 2-day course model for teaching communication skills to terminally ill patients, which resulted in significant improvements in communication behavior, including increased sensitivity and professionalism in communication with patients."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The reliability of structured implicit chart reviews for assessing the quality of care for chronic diseases and acute conditions is influenced by the quality of the evidence base for practice. The study suggests that peer review can improve the reliability of implicit chart reviews for chronic diseases and acute conditions, particularly for diabetes and hypertension. However, the reliability of single physician reviews for chronic diseases and acute conditions is lower compared to other methods."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that nulliparous women are more likely to experience unsuccessful IUD insertions compared to parous women. However, the study also suggests that parous women may experience unsuccessful insertions more frequently. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore potential interventions to improve insertion success rates."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction can result in significant savings in operative time and cost savings compared to freehand planning and guided surgery. However, the savings are offset by additional costs for planning and cutting-guide production. The savings are significant, but not all cases can be self-funding through the time saved."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the risk of suicidal behavior between major affective disorder polarity and bipolar polarity. However, bipolar participants had more severe attempts and had a higher prevalence of active substance abuse."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The use of polyvalent antivenin in rattlesnake bites is associated with a high incidence of acute side effects, including urticaria, rash, and fever. However, no deaths, amputations, or permanent disability occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. The most common side effects were mild to moderate in severity, with a mean number of vials given to each snakebite grade."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant change in left ventricular wall motion or functional class after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, as evidenced by a significant increase in peak levels of lidocaine and its metabolite MEGX at specific laser settings."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The quality of vaccine storage in the community is weak, with a significant number of practices not aware of the appropriate storage conditions and monitoring of temperatures. The use of temperature gauges and external temperature gauges in refrigeration monitoring systems is recommended to improve the quality of vaccine storage."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that p53 alterations, specifically p53 mutations, can predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer, with a significant reduction in tumour size and local failure in the group with p53 mutations. However, no significant difference in response to therapy was observed between the p53 wild-type and p53 mutated groups."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) is an effective treatment for necrotizing fasciitis, but the mortality rate is higher in patients who receive HBO as part of their treatment protocol. The length of hospitalization for survivors is also shorter in the HBO group. The choice of HBO therapy should be based on individual patient factors and the severity of the disease."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients can be treated with higher doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) in tritherapy, with a high rate of seizure reduction and good tolerance to other antiepileptic drugs. However, further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of zonisamide in this population."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the overexpression of Ki-67 in upper tract urinary carcinoma is an independent prognostic factor for poorer cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that MRI can be a valuable tool for the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee, particularly in cases with meniscal damage and ligament injuries. However, it is important to note that MRI can also reveal other types of injuries, such as bone bruises and subcortical areas of signal loss, which can be missed by conventional radiography."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with motor neuron disease exhibit significant cognitive deficits, particularly in language function, which may be associated with the development of dementia. However, the study also suggests that aphasia may be a more common presentation in motor neuron disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a definitive relationship between dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients experienced a decrease in their nasal tip sensation after microfat grafting, but the sensation returned to normal within a few weeks. The percentage of those experiencing paresthesia also decreased."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders, including severe to profound hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder, can impact the accuracy of musical communication, with children with autism spectrum disorder showing poorer performance compared to typical-development children."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with osteoarthritis pain may find using colour to describe their pain to be a useful approach, but further research is needed to confirm its acceptability and feasibility. The findings suggest that using colour to describe osteoarthritis pain can be a useful approach, but further research is needed to establish its clinical utility and interpretability."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that intensive chemotherapy regimens for breast and colorectal cancers in rural patients are safe, with similar rates of serious adverse events and dose intensities compared to urban patients. However, the study also suggests that rural patients may experience a higher incidence of febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery and radiation therapy significantly improve survival in patients with extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, particularly in those with gastrointestinal disease. Age, gender, stage, and radiation therapy were independent predictors of survival."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the incidence of delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy is not significantly reduced by modifying the original reconstructive anatomy, but it is still observed in a small number of patients. The incidence of DGE is significantly higher in patients who experience postoperative complications other than delayed gastric emptying."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse. The presence of pelvic pain is also associated with straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that c-kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target, as it maintains a high phosphorylation level and can be inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, further research is needed to determine the clinical significance of this finding."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that telmisartan does not prevent hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes, but it may have a protective effect against hepatic degeneration. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The survey suggests that transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease is not a common practice in the United States, but most transplant centers do not perform such transplants. The majority of responding centers would not transplant an HIV-infected patient into a good candidate for transplantation, but a small number of centers would consider transplanting a cadaveric or living donor into an HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate. The majority of transplant centers believe that transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual and would not consider transplanting a cadaveric or living donor into an HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can be useful in assessing extensive disease or metastases, but it is not routinely performed for all patients. The study suggests that it may lead to additional unresectable tumors in some patients, but the accuracy of the procedure is moderate. The biopsy of the contralateral liver can lead to changes in management for some patients, but the overall accuracy is moderate."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ, as it can lead to significant variability in pathologic reporting and impact on treatment recommendations."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vaginal pH can be measured from the wet mount slide using a cotton swab or cytobrush, but the accuracy of this method is influenced by the presence of bacteria and other contaminants in the vaginal fluid."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, oral mucocele/ranulas are another human immunodeficiency virus-related salivary gland disease, with a higher prevalence of HIV infection in HIV-positive patients. The study also suggests that HIV-positive patients are more likely to present with plunging ranulas."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The present meta-analysis suggests that central venous pressure does not reliably predict fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing fluid management decisions. The correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in cardiac performance was moderate, but not perfect."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups for acute appendicitis. However, the study did find that patients with a higher number of leukocytes had a higher D-dimer level."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death by regulating mitochondrial dynamics, including the formation of the PTP."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Transurethral catheterisation is a safe and effective method for bladder drainage, but it is associated with discomfort and increased risk of urinary tract infection. Male patients are more dissatisfied than female patients."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that risk stratification of gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever can be useful in identifying high-risk patients, but it is important to note that it is not a definitive tool and further research is needed to establish its clinical utility. The study also suggests that high-risk patients may have a higher risk of complications and death."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that halofantrine may be ototoxic, as evidenced by changes in inner and outer hair cells, spiral ganglia cells, and inner and outer phalangeal cells. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a definitive conclusion."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "The elderly with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are undertreated, with a significant number of patients not receiving treatment. The benefit of aggressive therapy in this population is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in opioid consumption between neonates undergoing minimal access surgery and conventional surgery of esophageal atresia."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that clinical predictors, such as neck tenderness, are not adequate in the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, with a significant decrease in protein, fat, and cholesterol intakes and a significant increase in fiber intake over the 7-year follow-up. However, European recommendations for adequate nutrient intake were not followed in this population."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty by affecting the amount of decreased gaps in knee flexion position. The reduction of patella position leads to larger gaps in knee extension and flexion, which may contribute to increased or decreased knee flexion position variability."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA, which is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in the modulation of hippocampal synaptic transmission. The release of GABA by mossy fibers is facilitated by metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists and NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant gender differences in the prevalence or incidence rates of major depression, as assessed by self-report, in East Baltimore population-based samples."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between delays in time to primary treatment and survival in breast cancer patients. However, Malay ethnicity was associated with delayed treatment."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ADMA levels in young adults born preterm are inversely correlated with gestational age and birth weight, suggesting an increased risk of early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of electrochemiluminescence assays in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet subjects can improve the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in terms of risk, as shown by a significant association between autoantibodies and progression to diabetes within 6 years of initial visit. The use of ECL assays also improved the receiver operating characteristic curves, with a higher AUC for C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, and AUC glucose. Additionally, adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score improved the receiver operating characteristic curves."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is a significant association between past group A streptococcal infection and an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. However, further research is needed to confirm this association and establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a rare but potentially fatal condition, characterized by the development of lung lesions that are characterized by the presence of fibrin and organizing granulomas. The exact mechanism of AFOP development remains unclear, but it is likely due to the presence of immune dysregulation, as evidenced by the presence of antibodies and other immune-related findings."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that women who received antenatal corticosteroid administration for preterm rupture of membranes or twins had a higher likelihood of delivering at 34 weeks or later compared to those who delivered at or before 34 weeks. However, the study also suggests that women who received antenatal corticosteroid administration for premature preterm rupture of membranes or twins had a higher likelihood of delivering within 24 hours. The study also suggests that women who received antenatal corticosteroid administration for premature preterm rupture of membranes or twins had a higher likelihood of delivering within 24 hours. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the likelihood of delivering within 24 hours between women who received antenatal corticosteroid administration for premature preterm rupture of membranes or twins and those who did not."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that fibromyalgia is more common in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome who report fatigue, but the prevalence of fatigue in this group is not statistically significant compared to the general population. However, the prevalence of FM in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is significantly higher than in the general population."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter is a significant predictor of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The HINT1 gene is not a significant candidate for schizophrenia based on the findings from the Irish study and the case control study. However, the study suggests that certain SNPs, specifically rs3864283 and rs1875389, may be associated with schizophrenia. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish a definitive role for HINT1 in schizophrenia."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The use of the acute phase sacral sparing measurements, specifically the combination of voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 light touch, can improve the prognostic value in determining independent ambulation in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive changes in brain structure and function in schizophrenia, with significant differences in whole brain volume, gray matter, frontal white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter between patients and healthy control subjects."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pre-operative fasting blood glucose levels are associated with an increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The risk is higher for patients with IFG and SDM compared to those with complete diabetes mellitus."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration, with a higher ISF penetration and faster elimination. However, the study also suggests that the ISF concentrations may vary depending on the specific haemodiafiltration regimen used."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is an early stage disease, with a 5-year survival rate of 63%. Factors such as histology, size, and presence of negative resection margin are significant prognostic factors."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, gout patients know their serum urate goal, but only a small percentage of them know it completely. Factors associated with greater knowledge include having a rheumatologist as initial prescriber and knowing all of the other gout-specific knowledge questions."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded low-income vision care programs have a positive impact on the utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals, as shown by a higher prevalence ratio of utilization among those with financial difficulties. However, the program is still insufficient for all types of eye care services, including those not covered by lenses."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural mothers have poorer outcomes in terms of neonatal outcomes, including poorer perinatal outcomes, higher mortality, and higher stillbirth rates compared to urban mothers."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Endothelin-1 plays a role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis, as shown by increased ET-1 levels in patients with end-stage renal disease and rebound hypertension."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "Frozen section analysis does not significantly alter the surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease, but it can lead to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in some cases. However, the sensitivity of frozen section for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer is low."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Elderly cancer patients have different care needs, with older patients expressing more financial-insurance information, a greater need for information from doctors and nurses, and a greater need for a better dialogue with clinicians. However, there are no significant differences in the requests for intimacy and support."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "Globulomaxillary cysts are not a new entity, but rather a subset of cystic lesions that can occur in the nasal and maxillary processes. The findings from this study suggest that they may be more common than previously thought, and that they may be associated with various pathologies, including periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumours, adenomatoid odontogenic tumours, periapical granulomas, and undefined jaw cysts."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Fear of recurrence is a significant predictor of fear of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors, with fear of recurrence being directly related to pre-treatment fears and optimism."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials have a higher prevalence of symptoms, including pain, and a greater number of symptoms, which may impact their prognosis. Symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting are common and may impact functional status."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea is associated with a significant improvement in sleep quality and overall quality of life, as indicated by improvements in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). However, some patients may have difficulties in complying with the therapy and stopping it after the first month. The study also suggests that heated humidification may improve the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which provides cash benefits to low-income elderly, can lead to a decrease in disability among those aged sixty-five and older. The program's impact on disability is significant, with a significant number of individuals experiencing mobility limitations. The study suggests that the program's benefits may be linked to a decrease in disability rates among those most likely to receive benefits. However, the study also suggests that the program may not be the primary determinant of population health in the elderly population. The study suggests that income support policies, such as the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, may have a role in improving population health in this population."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study identified several clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, including global loss of passive range of movement, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements. However, the absence of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains a significant issue."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "The use of cough and cold medicines in young children following the FDA warnings has not been consistently addressed in the literature. The study identified a significant number of caregivers who did not administer cough or cold medicines to their children, and a significant number of children did not receive the prescribed dose. The use of cough and cold medicines in young children following the FDA warnings is still a concern, as only a small percentage of caregivers demonstrated the correct dosing."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin C can prevent the development of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, as shown in the study where the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was significantly lower in patients who received vitamin C than in those who received a placebo. However, the effect was dose-dependent, with a higher prevalence observed in patients receiving the higher doses. Early cast-related complaints were also associated with an increased risk of developing complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that plate clearing tendencies are a risk factor for obesity in US adults. The association between plate clearing and obesity was significant after adjusting for other factors such as BMI."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that clinicians should not rely solely on chest radiography for the diagnosis of acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease. The sensitivity of chest radiography for diagnosing ACS is low, but diagnostic accuracy does not improve significantly with increasing pediatric training."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in the quality of TME surgery between colorectal trainees under supervision and consultants. However, there were more cases of local recurrences in trainees when compared to consultants."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there are opportunities for improvement in the school food policy and implementation, particularly in the areas of rules and enforcement. However, most principals and teachers reported that the school had a written food policy, but most parents reported that it is a responsibility of the school to foster healthy eating habits among children. The study also suggests that parents were primarily responsible for promoting healthy eating habits, but some parents felt that the school should enforce the policy more strongly."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The findings from the study suggest that schizophrenia patients may have a motion perception deficit, which may be related to their eye-tracking abnormalities. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding and establish a causal relationship."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation. However, there was a significant overlap in the distribution of SRF between patients with atrial fibrillation and those without atrial fibrillation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Anastomotic leakage does not significantly impact functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer, as assessed by continence score and anal manometry. However, it does impact anal function, as indicated by a slightly but not significantly worse maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between the presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and neurologic outcomes after traumatic cervical cord injury. However, the static and dynamic canal diameters at C3 and C4 were significantly smaller in the OPLL+ group compared to the OPLL- group."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences are associated with height, with a negative correlation between waist circumference and height in men and a positive correlation in women. However, the relationship between circumferences and height is complex, with some relationships being stronger than others. The study suggests that both waist circumference and hip circumference can be used as risk indexes for height, but the relationship between circumferences and height is more complex in men and women."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Pain is a common problem in general adult psychiatry, with a prevalence of approximately 50%. The most common complaints are low back pain, headache, and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective disorders, neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and psychotic disorders are most frequently affected. Impairment and unfitness for work are related to specific psychiatric diagnoses. Depression and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals are risk factors."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Age does moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients, with older adults reporting less dysfunctional coping strategies and less personality disorder, but not gender, age, or Axis I diagnosis."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between the presence of cervical cord plaques and the presence of cervical discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine laboratory markers, such as the MCV, AST/ALT ratio, and sex, can differentiate nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis, but the AST/ALT ratio and age are more important predictors of high-grade fibrosis."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, immediate breast reconstruction can compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, as there is a higher risk of complications, including seromas, in the immediate group compared to mastectomy alone."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis holds that inequalities in coverage of cancer screening are primarily driven by economic factors, rather than by differences in access to health care. The study found that economic inequalities in coverage of cancer screening were significantly lower or non-existent in countries with higher coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in postoperative morbidity between tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. However, the use of antibiotics did not significantly affect the length of hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring as a part of depression care in clinical psychiatry is effective and feasible, with a high rate of clinical changes and treatment changes. However, measurement-based care approaches are not commonly used in clinical practice."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in the outcomes between the sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. Both procedures resulted in similar functional outcomes, pain, and social functioning scores."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme is a feasible and cost-effective intervention for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as they pass all the physical tests and demonstrate a high rate of success in completing the self-managed foot care program. However, patients who fail the physical tests may have longer disease duration and higher physical disability, pain, and general health scores."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality is not significantly influenced by the spatial heterogeneity in the socio-economic deprivation distribution in Scotland. However, the relationship does vary between regions, with the West region showing a higher correlation with mortality than the rest of Scotland."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that effective implementation of evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive processing therapy, is associated with a higher proportion of variability in outcome due to therapists, particularly in terms of symptom severity. However, the study also identified characteristics of effective therapists, including effective addressing patient avoidance, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location, with some groups being more likely to be diagnosed and prescribed antidepressants and others not. The study found that black and minority ethnic groups were more likely to be diagnosed with depression and prescribed antidepressants, while Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and black Caribbean patients were more likely to be diagnosed and prescribed antidepressants. The effect of neighbourhood ethnic density on depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing was also observed for some groups, but the effect was no longer statistically significant for black Caribbean patients."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease, with higher levels of knee extensor strength and dynamic stability being associated with better functional ambulation."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that preloading with colloids before starting general anesthesia can prevent hemodynamic changes during seated positioning in neurosurgical patients. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of preloading colloids in this population."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the response to intravenous thrombolysis between men and women in ischemic stroke patients. However, male sex was associated with a higher risk of mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary for the placement of totally implantable venous access devices without antibiotic prophylaxis. However, the study also reports a higher rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in patients who received antibiotics during the procedure."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel in the surgical extraction of mandibular third molars can enhance healing by reducing pain, swelling, and interincisal mouth opening, but the difference in healing was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant discrepancy between patient and physician assessments of quality of life in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Physicians underestimate the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on social limitations and emotions, while overestimating the impact on physical functioning."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of metabolic syndrome is associated with increased heart dimensions, including interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "The study identified that elevated plasma viscosity and starting treatment at higher prednisolone doses were independent predictors of a shorter duration of steroid therapy in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. Additionally, female sex, HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles, and starting prednisolone dose above 15 mg were identified as predictors of late development of GCA."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that surgical resection is not necessary in the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus, as the overall survival and disease-free survival were similar between the two groups. However, the recurrence rate was higher in arm B."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that beta-endorphin deficiency during alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety and depression in alcoholics, as indicated by a significant correlation between beta-endorphin levels and anxiety and depression scores. However, the correlation was largely independent of ACTH levels."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that increased private outpatient referral rates are associated with a greater demand for NHS care, particularly in areas with the highest deprivation."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation. However, the study did find that the incidence of extreme skewing in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population was higher in women with a history of spontaneous abortions compared to those without. However, the difference was not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the receipt of hospice care in nursing homes is associated with a higher likelihood of receiving regular treatment for daily pain, particularly acetaminophen and morphine derivatives."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that residents in an academic vascular department had a significantly higher rate of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision-making process for patients undergoing vascular procedures compared to elective cases admitted before the day of surgery."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "Oophorectomy in children with ovarian torsion is not necessary for successful treatment, but detorsion may be necessary in cases where the ovary is considered moderately to severely ischemic. However, the risk of complications and length of stay are similar between the two methods."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography may not be sufficient for depicting the abdominal aorta and its major branches, as the SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio of the abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries were significantly lower in the 0.5 mL/second groups compared to the 1 mL/second groups."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support an increase in reported unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV-infected individuals over time. The majority of individuals reported unsafe sex, but there was no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time. Females, 15-30 year olds, those with HIV-positive partners, and those with occasional partners were more likely to report unsafe sex."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cytostatic treatment may be an independent predictor of improved survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients, particularly in those with ECOG scores of 0 to 1. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of this treatment in the management of advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared with HMOs or primary care case management in Florida's Medicaid program, particularly for SSI and TANF enrollees. However, savings are observed among TANF enrollees."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire is a useful tool for the detection of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men, with a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 19.7%. However, it is important to note that the tool is not a definitive diagnosis and further testing is needed for definitive diagnosis. The ADAM questionnaire can be used to screen for PADAM, but it is important to note that it is not a definitive diagnosis and further testing is needed for definitive diagnosis."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor, with excellent correlation between VAS and fetal blood pH in both term and preterm gestations, and a negative VAS response for predicting fetal acidosis. However, the predictive value of fetal acidosis is lower for late decelerations compared to early decelerations. The predictive value of fetal acidosis for neonatal morbidity is similar for both groups of decelerations."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of emergency ultrasound (EUS) fellowship programs can significantly impact emergency medicine (EM) residents' ultrasound education, as indicated by a higher number of US examinations performed, a higher number of applications of bedside US, and significant differences in barriers to US education between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Obesity is associated with an increased risk of rib fractures and pelvic injuries in children, but there is no significant difference in mortality between obese and non-obese children."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that abscesses, phlegmons, and recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis are contraindications to laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in patients with Crohn's disease. However, conversion to open procedures was not common. The length of hospital stay was longest in group IV."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year in which radical prostatectomy was performed is a predictor of outcome in prostate cancer, as shown by a significant association between the year and postoperative outcomes. However, the relationship between year and preoperative outcomes was not significant."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women with a prior major depression history had a lower risk of developing major depression during midlife compared to those without a history. However, the risk profiles differed, with women with a prior depression history having a higher risk of developing major depression during midlife. The risk factors for first lifetime-onset major depression were psychological symptoms and psychological distress during follow-ups."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that early extubation is associated with lower mortality and shorter length of intensive care unit stay in children undergoing congenital heart surgery. However, it is important to note that the study also suggests that early extubation may be associated with complications, including reintubation, and that the decision to extubate should be individualized based on individual patient factors."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors such as farming, working lifetime, and high occupational silica exposure are significant risk factors for primary systemic vasculitis. Other factors such as high occupational solvent exposure during working lifetime, drug allergy, and allergy overall are also significant risk factors."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates that a flexible reamer system can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, as evidenced by a statistically significant difference in mean intra-osseous length between the 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 groups. However, there were no significant differences in distance to the common peroneal nerve or femoral attachment of the LCL between the 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 groups."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the elapsed treatment time significantly influences the outcome of radiotherapy for prostate cancer, with a higher elapsed treatment time leading to a higher risk of biochemical failure. The risk is independent of other factors such as tumor stage, initial prostate-specific antigen level, and Gleason score."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that single-valve replacement for patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis who have both mitral and aortic prosthesis is associated with a high positive predictive value for the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis, but it is associated with a higher risk of relapse. However, the study also suggests that single-valve replacement may be safe in selected cases."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute hepatitis C infection in Israel is predominantly iatrogenic, with a significant number of cases being caused by iatrogenic transmission. The most common transmission route is iatrogenic, with iatrogenic transmission being the most common mode of transmission. The study also suggests that injecting drug use is a significant transmission route for acute hepatitis C infection in Israel."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that breast-feeding is associated with lower rates of illness in children with a family history of atopy, particularly in the first year of life. However, it is important to note that the study also suggests that breast-feeding may lead to fewer episodes of gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and digestive tract disorders in the first year of life."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve prostate cancer detection in enlarged prostates, particularly in those with larger prostates. The detection rate is inversely associated with prostate specific antigen."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not provide evidence to support the use of regional anesthesia as compared to general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture. However, the study did find that patients who received regional anesthesia had a lower rate of in-hospital mortality and higher rates of ICU admission and readmission."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that direct mesocolon invasion is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with advanced gastric cancer, but the survival benefit is more pronounced in patients with incurable factors."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that mutations in the LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1 genes are associated with a lower HDL cholesterol level and increased carotid intima-media thickness. However, the study did not find a significant correlation between HDL cholesterol and carotid intima-media thickness."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as shown by a significant correlation with the MacNew global score and a significant regression model."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that specialty care, specifically cardiology and cardiology clinics, may be associated with improved survival in patients with congestive heart failure. The risk of death was higher in patients in the no-GM/CARD group compared to those in the cardiology and general medicine groups."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is no significant intrauterine influence on obesity levels in young women, as the associations between maternal and paternal BMI were similar for both parents. However, the study also suggests that the strength of the association between maternal BMI and offspring BMI is stronger than that between paternal BMI and offspring BMI."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead donors can be a useful tool for assessing left ventricular dysfunction, but it is not a definitive diagnostic tool and should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools such as echocardiography. The study suggests that a higher degree of left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50%) is associated with a higher risk of transplantation failure. However, the study also suggests that transplantation can be successful in some cases, with a higher degree of left ventricular function (FAC>50%) in some cases."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation is a lethal practice, with a high prevalence and a wide age range, and can lead to unintended death. The syndrome can be conceptualized as a personal, ritualized, and symbolic drama, involving intense emotional feeling-states involving an identification and sadomasochistic relationship with a female figure. Inept autoerotic asphyxiation practitioners can miscalculate the peril of the situation and lose their gamble with death."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that STIR imaging at both field strengths can be effective in detecting bone metastases, with a higher sensitivity and better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation, and image quality on STIR compared to T1w sequences. However, the sensitivity of STIR is lower than that of T1w sequences at 3 T. The qualitative analysis suggests that STIR images are more effective at detecting fewer metastases compared to T1w sequences."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The agreement between approved doctors and medical referees in the UK is poor, with a moderate degree of disagreement for certain conditions and factors such as experience and knowledge of the MRs and their interpretation of the standards. The commonest reasons for changing fitness categories or restrictions are access to additional information by the MRs."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of kidney damage in women with more parities."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of a fast-resorbable hydrogel coating on implants can reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. The coating can be applied during implant insertion and can be resistant to press-fit insertion."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity significantly influences where people with cancer die, with the majority of deaths occurring in hospital, with a significant decline in home deaths and a higher risk for deaths in hospice and other geographical regions."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary do not have Lynch syndrome, as they do not meet the revised Bethesda Criteria for MMR defects. However, they do have a higher risk for other cancers, including endometrial and ovarian cancer."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that low birth weight is not an indicator of congenital cytomegalovirus infection, as CMV-DNA was detected in four out of the 200 newborns tested. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that better process of care in ambulatory care settings is associated with better health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The study developed a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese adults, which was found to be accurate and comparable to other established equations for a wide range of BMI values. However, it was found to have limitations in terms of accuracy for a BMI greater than 23."}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, remote physician-examiners can participate from a distance in an objective structured clinical examination (reOSCE) by providing feedback on their performance and providing feedback on the examination itself. However, technical issues such as distance and time constraints may limit their ability to complete the examination."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, with an increased odds of adverse maternal outcomes and a reduced odds of adverse neonatal outcomes."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The head-down position during liver surgery can lead to a higher risk of venous air embolism compared to head-up position. However, the effect on central and hepatic venous pressure is not significant."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of arsenic exposure among Swedish art glass workers, particularly in combination with cardiovascular disease. However, the risk is higher for those with diabetes mellitus as an underlying cause of death. The risk is higher for glassworkers, particularly for those with cardiovascular disease."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current readiness guidelines for Israeli hospitals for multiple casualty incidents may not adequately predict the severity of the incidents, as only 79.2% of casualties did not necessitate immediate medical treatment."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease, with a higher percentage of patients receiving treatment for both definitive and presumptive diagnoses."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the isolated right hemisphere can read phonologically impaired individuals, but the relationship between phonological processing and reading levels is complex and not fully understood. The findings suggest that phonological awareness and verbal memory skills, which are essential for reading, may not be the same in individuals who have undergone cerebral hemispherectomy."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eliminating \"missed opportunities\" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings could potentially reduce racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination by approximately one half. However, the impact on vaccine uptake and vaccination coverage is not clear-cut."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis can be achieved by using a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index, which can predict the presence or absence of esophageal varices with high accuracy and high negative predictive values."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is less invasive than radical retropubic radical prostatectomy, as evidenced by lower levels of interleukin-6, CRP, and lactate at the end of surgery and higher levels of lactate at the end of the recovery period. However, the study also suggests that the acute phase reaction is not proportional to surgery-induced tissue damage. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal timing for robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of a defined skin care protocol in critically ill patients can significantly reduce the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis. The study found that the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in the intervention group was significantly less than in the control group."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in pain control in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. The intervention led to a significant reduction in disparities in pain control in both groups."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Insulin resistance is a significant contributor to the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk, as shown by the non-significant association between fasting glucose and the Framingham risk score after adjusting for insulin sensitivity. However, the association between 2-hour glucose and cardiovascular risk remains significant even after adjusting for insulin sensitivity."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy can be a useful tool in preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment in newborns with esophageal atresia, but it is important to note that it can also lead to complications such as unsuspected fistulas and malformations of the respiratory tree. The study suggests that preoperative tracheobronchoscopy can be a useful tool in improving diagnosis and surgical treatment in type A and B patients, but it is important to note that it can also lead to complications such as unsuspected fistulas and malformations of the respiratory tree in type C patients."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The validation of the 2009 TNM staging system for primary tumor classification in renal cell carcinoma is ongoing, but the findings suggest that the new classification of T2 cancers, including T2b and T3a tumors, is an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival. However, the new classification of T3b and T4 tumors does not retain an independent predictive role. The study also suggests that the new classification of T1 tumors does not retain an independent predictive role. The limitations of the study include a retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and small sample size."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system only had a modest ability to predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. The study found that the system had a poor ability to predict head, chest, and abdomen injuries. The study also found that the system had a higher mortality rate for unstable fractures compared to stable fractures."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parity increases insulin resistance during pregnancy, as indicated by a decrease in insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and an increase in beta-cell function (basal plasma C peptide/fasting plasma glucose) in women with a history of pregnancy. This association is age-dependent and is influenced by prepregnancy BMI and weight gain."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cognitive function, specifically working memory and working memory capacity, is a significant predictor of frequency-compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "The beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes is associated with an increased risk for TTN, particularly in beta1Ser49 homozygotes."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in bariatric surgery outcomes between patients who participated in a medically supervised weight loss program and those who did not. However, the study did find that participation in a MSWM program did lead to a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in early hemodynamic results or complication rates between patients who underwent TAVI using a standard procedure and those who underwent TAVI using a protocol where balloon predilatation was omitted."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in recanalization rates, time to recanalization, or clinical outcomes between men and women after IV rt-PA treatment for acute stroke."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Yes, serum can be used for analyzing the EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, with a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum and matched tumor samples. However, there is a high risk of false positives in serum samples, as EGFR mutations can be detected in both serum and tumor samples. The response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors is significantly associated with EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of Web-based systems in medical oncology is a significant factor influencing the uptake and use of these systems in the Australian setting. Clinicians need autonomy and time to develop their own protocols, while the availability of appropriate infrastructure and the availability of appropriate software are also important factors."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, being small for gestational age is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity, as it is associated with an increased risk of developing any stage or severe stage of retinopathy of prematurity. Additionally, weight gain from birth to the sixth week of life and need for blood transfusions are significant risk factors for severe retinopathy of prematurity."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that fast food consumption is associated with an increased risk of asthma and allergy, particularly in children. However, the risk is not independent of other lifestyle factors such as other diet and BMI."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass is an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia in patients with critical leg ischemia and insufficient venous material for a straightforward femorocrural reconstruction. However, the study also suggests that the primary patency and limb salvage rates were not significantly different between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can be used to measure pupil size, with good intraobserver and interobserver repeatability and high sensitivity and specificity for detecting pupils larger than 6 mm. However, the method requires a high degree of expertise and requires a trained eye. The method also has a relatively low sensitivity for detecting pupils smaller than 6 mm."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with distinct patterns of atrophy observed in specific types of FTLD. These patterns of atrophy are associated with specific genetic variants and clinical phenotypes."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased patient awareness of clinical trials can lead to an increase in accrual into clinical trials. Patients who indicated an inclination to participate in clinical trials tended to have greater satisfaction with the information they received."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients at high falls risk may not be adequately assessed for osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment in the previous 2 years, and may receive fewer strategies for falls prevention. The guidelines for falls prevention in rehabilitation should be followed."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The expert consensus statement recommends that follow-up visits for patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices should be implemented within 2 to 12 weeks, with a higher frequency among white patients and those of other races. However, the number of patients who are eligible for follow-up visits is still relatively low, with a significant number of patients not attending all follow-up visits. The rate of follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks improved significantly from 2005 to 2009."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CT attenuation values obtained from different CT scanners can lead to significant differences in stone composition, making it difficult to identify certain types of stones based on the CT attenuation values alone. The study also suggests that CT attenuation values obtained from different scanners can vary significantly, making it difficult to accurately classify stones based on the CT attenuation values alone."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK) have distinct biomechanical and wound healing characteristics compared to conventional LASIK, with ASA cases developing more rigid regions of the cornea and more extensive scarring, while SBK cases still have a short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Internet can be used to improve sexual health awareness in young people by providing information on sexual health topics, such as e-mail, games, chatlines, and homework. However, it is important to note that not all young people will use the website, and some may prefer to access the Internet through other means."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound is a more accurate method for the identification of fractures in pediatric patients compared to X-ray. However, it is not a definitive diagnostic tool for all types of fractures. The study suggests that X-ray is more effective in identifying fractures and dislocation, but it does not provide definitive evidence for its superiority over ultrasound in pediatric fracture diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "The infection control rates, number of additional procedures, length of hospital stay, and treatment duration were not significantly different between implant retention and two-stage revision treatment for infected TKA. However, type of treatment was associated with an increased risk of infection control failure."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that unmarried pregnant women in Poland have a higher risk for bacterial vaginosis, particularly Mycoplasma hominis, due to the presence of certain specific microbiological factors, such as young age, primary educational level, poor economic situation, and excessive smoking during pregnancy. However, the risk for other types of pathological microflora, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, was not significantly different between unmarried and married women."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concept mapping can enhance learning outcomes for nursing students by providing them with a more comprehensive understanding of the nursing process and by providing them with a more comprehensive understanding of the nursing process through the use of both traditional and concept mapping methods."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is significantly associated with an increased risk of hypertension in women, even after adjusting for other risk factors such as age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes status, and hypercholesterolemia."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form may enhance the quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients, as indicated by a cost-utility ratio of $45,540.49/QALYs. However, the study did not find a significant difference in cost-effectiveness between the FXD and FRC treatment regimens."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the combination of 2-methoxyestradiol with certain chemotherapeutices, such as epirubicine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil, and mafosfamide, can result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, different follow-up modalities, such as clinical visit alone, imaging alone, and cytologic examination, can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. The choice of follow-up modality should be based on individual patient factors and the specific clinical presentation."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Infundibular height, as measured by kidney ultrasound, can predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stone after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. However, it is important to note that other factors such as infundibular width, length, and length/width ratio also play a role in stone clearance."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Fournier's gangrene still poses a significant risk for mortality, with a mortality rate of about 20%. The mortality rate is higher in patients who survive compared to those who die. The mortality rate is higher in patients with a leukocyte count below 20,000/mm3."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that HTLV-I infection is associated with a variant form of HAM/TSP, characterized by inflammatory changes in the spinal cord, and the presence of anti-HTLV-I antibodies in both serum and CSF."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are risk factors such as male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presentation of participant information sheets can influence the perceived complexity of antenatal interventions, with the Double Fluent condition being more complex than the Double Awkward and Awkward Title-Fluent Font conditions."}
{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "The survey suggests that there is a lack of consensus among breast surgeons regarding the most common surgical practices for achieving negative margins in breast-conservation operations. The survey also shows that there is a wide range in acceptable margins, with some surgeons accepting any margin, others accepting a specific margin, and others accepting a wide range of margins."}
{"answers": "The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acupuncture is effective in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions, as evidenced by significant improvement in vocal function, perceived quality of life, and structural improvements. However, the no-treatment group did not show significant improvement."}
{"answers": "A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying \u226534 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in maternal or perinatal outcomes between cesarean delivery and vaginal delivery in women with eclampsia. However, the cesarean delivery group had a higher neonatal event rate."}
{"answers": "Based on data derived from self-reported health conditions, and not withstanding the limitations of such a study, we conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease are at higher risk of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and vice versa.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and the prevalence of periodontal disease. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in individuals with advanced forms of periodontal disease is significantly higher than in those with advanced forms of periodontal disease without rheumatoid arthritis."}
{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of epidural analgesia for labor is not a standard of effective analgesia for all women, as satisfaction levels and time course of epidural analgesia were not significantly different between clusters. However, the implementation of epidural analgesia for labor was associated with a decrease in VAS scores."}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that family practice at residency teaching sites in northeast Ohio is not reflecting the community practice of family physicians and general practitioners. The most common reasons for office visits were undifferentiated symptoms, with preventive and therapeutic services being offered more frequently. However, there were fewer diagnostic services performed and fewer consultations requested. The mean duration of visit differed by only 1 minute."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptors genes, specifically the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism, are associated with lower LDL-C levels in postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy. However, the association is not consistent across all lipid levels. The ESR2 rs3020450 and rs4986938 polymorphisms have been previously investigated and have been found to be associated with total cholesterol and LDL-C levels in postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that ankle/arm pressure does not reliably predict cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes. However, it was associated with higher mortality rates for ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and other causes."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that elderly individuals in Austria are not adequately protected against infectious diseases, particularly against tetanus, diphtheria, and influenza, despite regular vaccination. The elderly were not vaccinated according to recommended strategies, and low antibody concentrations and a short duration of protective humoral immunity were observed."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a dedicated discharge coordinator can significantly improve the quality of hospital discharge by improving the planning process, reducing problems experienced by patients, and improving the appropriateness and efficiency of care."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in pain intensity between patients who received local anesthesia and those who did not receive local anesthesia for MRa of the shoulder. However, there were significant differences in subjective pain perception between men and women."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the recurrence rate or length of hospital stay between patients who underwent endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones and those who did not. However, the use of a nasobiliary drainage tube after endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones was associated with longer procedure time and higher discomfort scores."}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is an inheritance pattern for Nasal Polyposis, with a higher prevalence of affected individuals in families with a personal history of NP compared to the general population. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and capsule endoscopy (CE) can be a feasible combined approach in acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), with a successful modification of management in four cases. However, the study also reports a higher detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesions in emergency DBE patients compared to OGIB patients."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic antireflux surgery can improve quality of life in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who are well controlled on medical therapy, as indicated by improvements in physical and mental composite scores, Psychological General Well-Being index, and gastrointestinal symptom scores."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients in rural and regional Australia are willing to participate in community-based medical education, as evidenced by a significant increase in patient participation in the study. However, they expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct some or all aspects of the consultation independently."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obstructive sleep apnea is associated with increased aerobic fitness, as indicated by increased maximum oxygen consumption, compared to a normal population. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index greater than 20 demonstrate decreased aerobic fitness as compared to normal values."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that pictorial health warning labels can address smoking-related health disparities by providing information that is more credible, relevant, and impactful for smokers compared to didactic forms. However, the effect of educational attainment on the impact of pictorial warnings on smoking-related health disparities is less clear."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between the number of arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites and hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between a family history of hyperlipidemia and serum lipid levels in school children. However, a higher prevalence of hyperlipidemia was observed in families with a history of hyperlipidemia."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of digoxin for cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The association is stronger for those with more than three PSA tests over the preceding 5 years."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that children and adults with growth hormone deficiency who received growth hormone replacement therapy had a higher risk of mortality compared to the general population. The risk was higher in women and after excluding high-risk patients."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that student examiners may not be as effective as faculty examiners in improving OSCE performance in medical emergencies. However, the study did find that students in the FE track had higher overall OSCE scores and overall OSCE evaluation scores compared to those in the SE track. The effect sizes for the OSCE stations were small, but significant."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the anal canal is associated with anal continence in women, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis. However, the exact role of these receptors in anal continence remains unclear. The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue in females suggests a role in anal continence, but the exact role of these receptors in anal continence in males is less clear. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of these receptors in anal continence."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that concomitant anterior/apical prolapse repair during midurethral sling improves the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence, as indicated by a significant improvement in the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity score. However, it does not significantly improve the overall symptom severity."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of sublingual varices is associated with an increased risk of hypertension. The positive predictive value of sublingual varices is 0.5, and the negative predictive value is 0.80."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "All normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were accurate and reliable in making street crossing decisions using visual and/or auditory information, with blind subjects being the least accurate. However, blind subjects were less reliable under the hearing only condition."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "The scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes can be a safe and effective initial surgical approach, with a low conversion rate and low rate of postoperative complications. However, it should be noted that it is important to note that impalpable testes can still be detected and treated with scrotal incision."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the enteral feeding advancement in very low birth weight infants is associated with an increased rate of sepsis, particularly late-onset sepsis, and a higher rate of central venous lines and antibiotics use."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "The sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery does not significantly influence the number of emboli passing distally, but it does influence the number of emboli detected and the time to dissection. The patient sub-group with current smokers had a significantly higher number of emboli and a longer dissection time."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that general practitioner hospitals have a lower rate of admissions and occupied bed days compared to populations without access to general hospitals. The differences were most pronounced for patients with respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, and cancer who are primarily or intermediately treated or cared for in general hospitals."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "Yes, evidence-based practice (EBP) leads to better patient outcomes, including lower mortality, shorter length of stay, and fewer readmissions, compared to standard practice (SP). However, the differences in outcomes and activity between the two groups were not statistically significant after the reorganization."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the distance to primary care provider is a significant barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer patients in Washington State. The study found that patients who traveled longer distances to the primary care provider had a higher likelihood of having late stage at diagnosis and longer time to treatment."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that self-efficacy plays a role in the relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and healthcare workers' sleep quality, but it does not mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound can be used as a diagnostic tool for constipation in constipated children, but it is not a definitive diagnosis and requires further evaluation and confirmation by other methods such as clinical examination and fecal analysis. The correlation between rectal diameter and age, height, weight, and bladder capacity, as well as the correlation between rectal anterior wall thickness and fecal load, suggest that ultrasound can be a useful tool for diagnosing constipation in constipated children. However, further research is needed to establish a definitive diagnostic criteria and establish a gold standard for the use of ultrasound in constipation diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a higher apical dose of 106Ru plaques can lead to improved local control and preservation of vision in posterior choroidal melanomas, but the overall 5-year survival rate was not significantly different between the two groups. However, the study also suggests that a higher dose may lead to complications such as macular degeneration or scarring. The choice of dose depends on individual patient factors and tumor characteristics."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a pressor is necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest, as evidenced by increased aortic pressures and coronary perfusion pressures during infusion. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the rate of return of spontaneous circulation or coronary perfusion pressures between the epinephrine and saline solution groups."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of citations to the reviewer's work can significantly impact the reviewer's evaluation of manuscripts. The study found that citations to the reviewer's work were associated with a higher mean reviewer score, but the effect was not significant after adjusting for the reviewer's own score. The study also found that the presence of citations to other work was associated with a higher mean reviewer score, but the effect was not significant after adjusting for the reviewer's own score."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a nurse-led preoperative education program significantly reduces anxiety and postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The intervention group had a greater decrease in state anxiety during the follow-up period compared to the control group."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that decreasing lengths of stay for selected diagnostic categories, such as acute myocardial infarction and bronchitis or asthma, may increase the risk of readmission and increase the number of physician visits after discharge. However, the correlation between length of stay and readmission rates was not significant in the study."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that solitary kidney is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys, as evidenced by a greater clearance rate and recovery rate in the solitary kidney model. However, further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms."}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours can decrease the incidence and severity of peripheral venous thrombophlebitis in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs. However, the correlation between the severity of PVT and the incidence of thrombosis is less strong in the study group."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the 3-phase bone scintigraphy method is a useful method for determining amputation levels in diabetic foot, with a high accuracy and low reamputation rates. However, it is important to note that it is not a definitive method and further research is needed to establish its clinical utility."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that socioeconomic status does not significantly impact the quality of life in lung cancer patients. However, there was a significant difference in quality of life scores between the socioeconomic status groups at baseline."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that residents' self-efficacy ratings were related to their observed performance during a small bowel repair, with residents who rated themselves as having higher self-efficacy levels using their assistant more often giving instructions."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch significantly influences the severity of traumatic aortic injury. The aortic arch angle is significantly associated with type III damage."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that clinical variables, such as pretreatment oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and presence of rales, can predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of wheezing, but only 15% of cases."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant first night effect on sleep bruxism in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. However, the study did find that patients with sleep apnea syndrome had higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration on the second night compared to the first night."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ventricular arrhythmias in athletes subside over time, as shown by a lower peak heart rate during the follow-up exercise test. However, the number of ventricular premature beats and ventricular couplets or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was significantly lower in athletes with ventricular arrhythmias compared to those without ventricular arrhythmias."}
{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a well developed collateral circulation is associated with an increased risk of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. The study found that patients with good collateral circulation had more severe coronary stenoses at baseline, and had more severe restenosis at six months post-PCI. Additionally, patients with good collateral circulation had more severe restenosis on quantitative coronary angiography. The study also found that stent diameter, stent length, and stent length >10% residual stenosis were predictive of restenosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that elderly donors can be implanted in young recipients, but the survival rate is not significantly different from that of young recipients. However, there are differences in renal function, including creatinine levels, and in the need for dialysis, between the two groups. The study also suggests that elderly donors may have a higher risk of rejection and acute rejection. The decision to implant elderly kidneys in young recipients should be based on individual patient factors and the specific transplant protocol."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "Patients do not fully understand their emergency department care and instructions, with a significant number of patients demonstrating deficient comprehension in at least one domain. The majority of these deficiencies are not perceived by patients."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in perioperative or postoperative thyroid function between hypothermic and normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. However, the study did find that hypothermic CPB resulted in a significant reduction in free T3 and mean serum rT3 levels on postoperative days 1 and 3."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that severe hypoglycaemia, defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose \u2264 54 mg/dL and requiring assistance or glucose \u2264 36 mg/dL, is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. The hazard ratio for severe hypoglycaemia was 1.78 (95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007)."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy in portal hypertension is a safe and effective procedure, with a lower morbidity rate and lower rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared to modified esophagogastric devascularization. However, the recurrence rate of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is higher in the EDWS group."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative pain levels can be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain, with a history of surgical pain and duration of prior pain being significant predictors. However, the study also suggests that prolonged preoperative pain can lead to postoperative sensitization of nociception neurons."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the correlation between general practice selection scores and MRCGP examination scores is significant."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "Prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are not the same diseases, but they can be associated with each other. Prostatic syndrome can be a precursor to pleural effusion, while pleural effusion can be a precursor to prostate cancer. The association between the two conditions is not clear-cut, but it is important to note that both conditions can occur in the same patient."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients is not necessary, as most reactions were mild and did not require ICU management. However, some severe reactions, such as hypotension and hypoxia, may require ICU management."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors can lead to a rebound aggravation of symptoms, as evidenced by higher symptom scores during the placebo period in the group given lansoprazole first."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The long-term outcomes of the transanal pull-through and transabdominal pull-through for Hirschsprung disease are not significantly different. However, the study did note that the TERPT technique resulted in better continence scores and a better stool pattern score."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use among elderly people has increased over the last decade, with a higher prevalence among women and men. The factors associated with a higher use of health care services include older age, lower educational level, worse self-rated health, chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and the level of disability."}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of homemade alcohol (Raksi) for embalming dead bodies can arrest postmortem changes and establish scientific fact that it can be an alternative to standard embalming constituent if it is not available."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "The holmium:YAG laser lithotripter is a safe and effective intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral stones, with a success rate of 92.7% at the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months. However, it is important to note that the success rate is not 100% and some ureteral stones may require additional intervention."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the severity of US-detected synovitis between patients with rheumatoid arthritis and those on s.c. anti-TNF agents."}
