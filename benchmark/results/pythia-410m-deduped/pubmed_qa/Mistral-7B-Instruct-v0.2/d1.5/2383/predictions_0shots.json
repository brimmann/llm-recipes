{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol in itself is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy, as indicated by a decrease in overall survival and a decrease in cancer-related death."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The use of delayed phase imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is associated with a significant increase in effective radiation dose."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive subscale is a useful tool for identifying cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors, as it is related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is associated with a higher risk of virologic relapse. However, the study did not find a significant difference in treatment duration between the two groups."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The diameter of the aneurysm is not a significant factor in the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aortic aneurysm rupture. However, the highest frequency of admission to the hospital was observed during periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric pressure were observed."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The sternal skin conductance (SSC) device is a reasonable surrogate for measuring hot flashes, with a concordance rate of 24% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. However, the device is not as accurate as the self-reported hot flashes, with a concordance rate of 31%."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral hip fracture, as it is a cost-effective method to prevent a contralateral hip fracture in women aged 70 to 75 years and younger. However, the success of prophylactic fixation is highly sensitive to the effectiveness and relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preresidency selection criteria, specifically USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores, USMLE Part I scores, and AOA membership, have a moderate linear correlation with objective measures of resident knowledge and performance, and a weak linear correlation with subjective ratings by faculty."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment is a useful tool for predicting in vitro fertilization outcome, as it is associated with a higher pregnancy rate and cancellation rate compared to age and FSH."}

{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early discharge with nurse home visits is associated with a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate and repeat specimens when the initial specimen is inadequate."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that high-dose radiotherapy may not be a significant benefit for palliative lung cancer patients compared to palliative treatment with 25\u00a0Gy in 5 fractions or 50\u00a0Gy in 20 fractions. However, the study also suggests that patients with a good-fair overall condition may have a better overall survival."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that leukocyte count and CRP measurements may not be essential for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly. However, the study did not find a statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with acute appendicitis and those with uninflamed appendix."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of desflurane during aortic surgery can alter left ventricular function, as evidenced by an increase in end-systolic wall-stress, end-systolic wall-stress index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index index, end-systolic wall-stress index"}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Adult patients with celiac disease who have a gluten-free diet for 20 years have a higher risk of developing tolerance to gluten compared to those who do not."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the 2001 WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers are appropriate in the South African context, with PM and FM providing adequate micronutrient intake and cost-effective preparation times. However, the study also suggests that PM and FM may not be as effective as commercial formula in providing vitamin D and linoleic acid."}

{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the presence of base deficit on admission is associated with a lower likelihood of favorable outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. However, the study did not find a statistically significant difference in mean BD between survivors and non survivors."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that infants with syncope during bathing may have an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria in their families, but the study did not find a significant difference in blood histamine levels between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly increases peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as evidenced by increased serum levels of beta-NAH and hyaluronic acid."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan can lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of sleep-related problems. However, the CHOPIT model provides a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "Fluoroscopy is essential for the successful retrieval of lower ureteric stones, as it can prevent the need for ureteroscopic removal. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant difference in stone clearance between patients who underwent ureteroscopic removal and those who did not."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of injury severity surrogates in the treatment of acetabular fractures with a posterior approach can influence the occurrence and severity of heterotopic ossification. The study found that the occurrence and severity of HO were significantly associated with the development of HO in a multivariate model."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Epidural analgesia for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis is a risky technique, with a risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis, and epidural abscess. The use of epidural analgesia for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) can lead to a significant risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis, and epidural abscess."}

In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary for the detection of pneumothorax in patients with pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy. However, it is important to note that the presence of symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax may delay the diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The timing of initial surfactant treatment does not appear to significantly impact the rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants. However, the early surfactant treatment group had a lower maturity and more severe CLD and mortality compared to the late surfactant treatment group."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that people who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave due to neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the mandibular depiction of double-oblique computed tomography images can be improved by changing the thickness of the images. However, the study did not find a significant difference in mandibular depiction between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Chemoradiation is a safe treatment option for mid and low rectal tumors, with a low risk of local recurrence and improved 5-year overall survival. However, it is important to note that the response to chemoradiation is not 100% and some patients may not be able to complete the treatment."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can be used to improve the predictive ability of risk models in conjunction with clinical assessment. The study found that the use of SNP scores and clinical assessment resulted in similar average 1-c-index values."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that insulin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes patients with controlled glucose levels and no evidence of treatment failure or weight gain is more effective than insulin in addition to oral hypoglycemic agents in improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic events. However, the study also suggests that insulin monotherapy may be associated with a lower satisfaction with treatment and general well-being."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as evidenced by its high serotonin 2 (5-HT2) and dopamine 2 (D2) occupancy, as well as its higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects compared to other atypical antipsychotics."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impairs uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome, as evidenced by a significant increase in neutrophil migration to high concentrations of interleukin-8 in the early postinjury phase."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT can be used as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease, as evidenced by a significant reduction in left parietal cortex rCBF in the AD group compared to healthy elderly."}

However, it is important to note that the procedure is not without complications, including minor complications such as sore throat in some cases."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Primary angioplasty is an acceptable alternative to thrombolysis for treating acute myocardial infarction, but it is associated with a higher satisfaction rate and a lower convenience of visiting primary angioplasty sites compared to thrombolysis."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count is a significant predictor of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death and a lower ejection fraction compared to pre-operative values. However, the optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement for optimal surgical outcomes remains unclear."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the early second-look tympanoplasty can reduce the conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy rate by approximately 3%."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) has had a significant impact on the quality of mammography in North Carolina. The inspection results indicate that mammography facilities have improved their quality standards, with a significant increase in the percentage of facilities meeting quality standards. However, the study also found that the quality standards were not uniform across all facilities, with some facilities having higher standards and others lower standards."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs.

Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that black patients had a higher likelihood of having their asthma severity underestimated compared to white patients. This was associated with less use of daily inhaled corticosteroids, less physician instruction on management of asthma flare-ups, and lower ratings of asthma care and physician communication."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly are not only accurate, but also accurate in identifying errors."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections is not significantly different between the first and second groups."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that apoptosis in mesial temporal sclerosis is not a common feature of this condition, but rather a specific feature of the condition, with increased Bax expression and caspase activation."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Golytely is more effective in terms of adenoma detection compared to MiraLAX. However, the difference in adenoma detection rate between the two preparations is not significant."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp is not a reliable predictor of a neoplastic polyp. However, older age and larger size are significantly associated with an increased risk of neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation may be a potential link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes.

{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score is a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients, as indicated by a statistically significant difference in mortality rates between survivors and patients who died on day 10. However, the APACHE II score at admission to the ICU is not independent of the effects of treatment and may lead to considerable bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the evaluation of treatment policies. Postoperative monitoring with the APACHE II score is clinically irrelevant. Inception cohort study. Secondary referral center. Eighty-five consecutive emergency surgical patients admitted to the surgical ICU in 1999. The APACHE II score was calculated before surgery; after admission to the ICU; and on postoperative days 3, 7, and 10. AP"}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available.

{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment in an Australian health service is associated with a significantly higher risk of death and hospital length of stay."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile was observed during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "The new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO) has led to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and the situation is likely to get worse in the near future. The implementation of the policy will lead to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes, overt diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will worsen in the near future. The implementation of the new WHO recommendations and the implementation of the new guidelines for the management of ART-related adverse effects in SSA will require significant efforts to prevent and mitigate the adverse"}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that chest wall rigidity may be a factor in the rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse. However, the study did not find any evidence of norfentanyl in the blood or urine of the victims."}

Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, social exclusion factors, specifically the 'economic/employment' and'social/welfare' dimensions, can influence suicide mortality. The influence of the'social/welfare' dimension is stronger among females."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans is a useful addition to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, as it can provide valuable information on the extent and invasion into the corpora. However, it is important to note that the study did not directly address the role of ultrasound in assessing the extent and invasion into the corpora."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, health care providers know what to teach with metered-dose inhalers, but they are less proficient in the proper use of the inhalers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the transverse apex of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is coincident with the coronal apex levels in most cases."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)\" sample is a more representative sample of child bipolar I disorder compared to the \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" study."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is still a broad consensus among country experts on the principles of good practice in health care for immigrants, with a significant number of factors being identified as the most important. However, there was a significant degree of discordance between countries, with some countries identifying specificities in migrant health care and prevention as the most important factors."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH.

{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, hepatitis G virus and TT virus are involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease, with a higher prevalence of severe liver damage in subjects with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints are a significant predictor of subsequent symptoms of depression in both men and women."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy can be predicted by respiratory data, including peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index, from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Inhibin, a new circulating marker of hydatidiform mole, is significantly higher in serum than in molar tissue and is present in high concentrations in the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles. However, its serum concentrations decline after evacuation, and its suppression is not observed in patients with persistent trophoblastic disease."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The use of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in MRM is a valuable tool for the semi-automatic analysis of dynamic MRM images, providing additional information about lesion vasculature. However, the study did not find a significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the most suspect curve and curve-type distribution percentage."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination is the main reason for not using minimal access techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, and blood transfusion, compared to multiparous women 30 years or older."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "Yes, women with major depression in pregnancy are identifiable in population health data, with a prevalence of approximately 16%."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients is true over time, with a higher number of episodes being observed in patients with more entries in the management information system."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the characteristics of a general practice, specifically the total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population, and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care, are associated with variations in the uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that nurses have a higher accuracy in predicting admission at triage compared to a simple objective score, but the accuracy is not significantly higher than that of a simple objective score."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin D deficiency is a significant feature of pediatric celiac disease, with a higher 25(OH)D level in non-obese children compared to obese children."}

However, the study also suggests that Army recruits have a higher prevalence of decayed teeth and treatment resource need compared to Royal Naval and Royal Air Force recruits."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that episodic migraineurs do not selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' low performance on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "The responsibility for the health care system's safety interventions is a significant factor in the public's valuation of these interventions. The study found that the public valued interventions preventing hospital-acquired infections more highly than genetic disorders, drug errors, and interventions to prevent injury to health care staff less highly."}

Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease is a safe and effective treatment option, with a high likelihood of achieving initial remission and a lower likelihood of relapse in the early postoperative period. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the likelihood of achieving remission between radiological and histological findings."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Chronic functional somatic symptoms are a significant and distinct feature of patients with functional somatic symptoms in general practice, with a higher prevalence and higher risk of developing them compared to controls."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The decision to refer a patient to a multidisciplinary team for breast cancer management is not always concordant with the team's recommendations. The decision to refer a patient to a multidisciplinary team may be justified due to the patient's choice, additional information available after the multidisciplinary team, or MDT error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is associated with a higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK, particularly in patients with skin and soft tissue infections. However, the significance of PVL in the pathogenesis of primary bacteraemia caused by S. aureus is uncertain."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy.

The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency medical services professionals should participate in disease prevention programs, with a higher proportion of those who have participated reporting that they have provided prevention services during emergency calls."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol are inadequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. The study suggests that the use of ergocalciferol as a treatment option may lead to a decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and a decrease in iPTH levels. However, the study also suggests that the use of ergocalciferol may lead to a decrease in iPTH levels."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a poor opioid response in cancer patients is associated with a higher pain intensity. However, the correlation between pain intensity and opioid response was not significant."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that treatment as prevention strategies in resource-limited settings may be feasible, with a significant number of patients achieving viral load suppression over time. However, the study also suggests that the risk of viral resistance may be a concern."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, with a ratio of approximately one third of the cross-sectional diameter of the pyloric mass and filling and obstructing the pyloric canal."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes was predictable in newborns, with true-negatives being more likely to pass both tests and being admitted into well-baby nursery compared to true-positives."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management at the same centre can improve the results of colorectal cancer resections by reducing the number of liver procedures and reducing the number of procedures performed. However, the use of chemotherapy prior to liver surgery is more common in the GM group."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that a high correlation between apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors is possible, with pleomorphic adenomas being more likely to be differentiated from other entities. However, the study also suggests that the differentiation of Warthin tumors from myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas may be more difficult."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The majority of UK radiologists are satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with a significant proportion of departments reporting initial reports by non-paediatric radiologists. However, only a small percentage of departments have a dedicated paediatric radiologist. The majority of departments do not have ready access to a paediatric radiology opinion. The majority of respondents thought that the service could be improved. Expert evidence was provided by a small percentage of respondents. Seventy-three percent would never consider providing expert evidence, even if given adequate radiology and/or legal training."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. The levels of TNFalpha at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that both smoking and alcohol intake are independent predictors of hypertension in Black South Africans, and that HIV infection is inversely associated with blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the Web-based sample of gay men with HIV was significantly more likely to report being in the upper physical symptom tertile compared to the clinic sample. However, the study also found that those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper physical symptom tertile compared to those not in employment."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, as evidenced by a median proximal migration of 0.83 mm and sagittal rotation of 1.3\u00b0."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians are associated with a higher risk of mortality and a lower quality of life compared to younger patients. However, the study also suggests that the quality of life of octogenarians is better than that of younger patients."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, open access endoscopy can significantly reduce the amount of information and explanation given to patients regarding their procedures and the nature of the procedure, leading to improved patient satisfaction and a higher likelihood of receiving endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "The volume of uterine myomas during pregnancy is a complex process, with a significant decrease in size and an increase in volume over time. The study suggests that the volume of uterine myomas may decrease, but the percentage of myomas that decrease in size is less than the percentage that increase."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that socioeconomic factors, specifically low birth weight and small head circumference, are associated with an increased risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood. However, the association between socioeconomic factors and intellectual performance is not confounded by familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "The addition of a second reader to the barium enema examination can increase the number of positive results, but the overall agreement between the first and second readings is less than perfect. The sensitivity for detecting adenocarcinomas is 100%."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (VMPA) using a vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) can improve access and reduce complications, including incision scarring, functional limitations, and permanent weakness of the facial nerve."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during primary lung cancer surgery is not necessary, but the metastasis status of the nodes is a significant factor in determining the survival of patients."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The FDA's warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs was not associated with a significant change in the trend of antiepileptic drug prescription claims."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The Department of Transportation and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors do not agree on the extent to which motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions are reported by the Ministry of Transportation."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the 2-day course model of communication with terminally ill patients can be successfully implemented in Rhineland-Palatinate, with high satisfaction and significant changes in communication behavior."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that peer review can be a valuable tool for assessing the quality of care for chronic disease and acute conditions, but the reliability of the instrument is lower than previously reported."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that nulliparous women are more likely to experience unsuccessful IUD insertions compared to parous women."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction is a cost-effective option, with a reduction in operative time of one minute compared to freehand surgery."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that bipolar participants had more prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse compared to major depressive participants, but the effects of risk factors were not different by polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The use of polyvalent antivenin in rattlesnake bites is associated with a higher risk of serious acute side effects, including urticaria, fever, and acute respiratory distress syndrome."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant change in left ventricular regional wall motion or ejection fraction after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, as evidenced by a significant increase in lidocaine levels and a significant increase in peak levels of lidocaine and its metabolite."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The quality of storage of vaccines in the community is weak, with a low adherence to Department of Health guidelines and a lack of monitoring of refrigeration temperatures."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, p53 alterations can be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer, as evidenced by a significant reduction in tumour size and local failure in the group with altered p53 status."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The use of hyperbaric oxygenation therapy in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis is associated with a lower mortality rate and shorter hospital stays compared to surgical excision and antibiotics alone."}

Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients can be treated with higher doses of zonisamide, with a high likelihood of achieving high seizure reduction and good tolerability."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the overexpression of Ki-67 in upper tract urinary carcinoma is a significant prognostic marker, with a statistically significant association between high Ki-67 expression and poor cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that MRI can be used as a substitute for conventional radiography in the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee, with a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional radiography. However, the study also suggests that the accuracy of MRI in detecting bone and cartilage injuries may be limited."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease are not necessarily mutually exclusive, with some patients having both conditions."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the sensation of the nasal tip after microfat grafting is not completely recovered, with a significant decrease in touch threshold value and a gradual decrease in percentage of those experiencing paresthesia."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders such as severe to profound hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder can impact the identification of musical messages. The study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder had significantly less accurate identification of emotional and movement categories compared to children with typical-development and normal hearing."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The colour of osteoarthritis pain can be described using colour, but the acceptability and feasibility of using colour to communicate pain to healthcare professionals is a significant concern. The study suggests that patients may not be able to associate their pain with a specific colour, and that the interpretation and standardization of colour may be challenging."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that intensive chemotherapy regimens for breast and colorectal cancer patients are safe, with a lower rate of serious adverse events and a lower dose intensity compared to urban patients. However, the study also suggests that the use of XELOX may be associated with a higher risk of febrile neutropenia and vomiting."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery or radiation therapy significantly improves survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the incidence of delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy is not significantly reduced by modifying the original reconstructive anatomy with a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy towards an antecolic duodenojejunostomy. However, the study also suggests that the incidence of postoperative complications other than delayed gastric emptying may be reduced."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that c-kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target, as evidenced by the inhibition of c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation. However, the IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was less than 2.5 microM."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease should be excluded from transplantation, but the majority of centers would not transplant them. The fear of harm and the concern that transplantation would be harmful to the individual were the primary concerns."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is a useful procedure, with a high accuracy of 27% and a low complication rate. However, it is important to note that the procedure may not be performed in all cases due to the presence of advanced tumor or nodal metastases."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ, as it can lead to significant variability in pathologic reporting and can contribute to a change in treatment recommendation."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vaginal pH can be measured from the wet mount slide using a cotton swab or wooden spatula. However, the accuracy of the measurement is influenced by the type of disturbance of the flora and infections studied and the diagnosis of the vaginal infections."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients.

{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups for acute appendicitis. However, the study did find that a lower Alvarado score was associated with a lower D-dimer level."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death, as evidenced by a decrease in perforations and mitochondrial dynamics similar to non-PCD cells."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes.

{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, with a significant decrease in protein, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intakes and a significant increase in fibre intake. However, European recommendations for adequate nutrient intakes were not followed."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with patella subluxation and eversion being associated with smaller gaps in knee flexion position compared to patella reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA during epileptogenesis, as evidenced by their ability to induce monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the higher rates of depression in women are not accounted for by differential symptom reporting."}

{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a rare but potentially fatal condition, with a high risk of fatal outcomes. The underlying immune dysregulation may be due to the presence of multiple lung nodules and a biopsy of a pulmonary lesion showing all the signs of AFOP. The diagnosis is based on the presence of multiple lung nodules and a biopsy of a pulmonary lesion, which is consistent with the diagnosis of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that women who received antenatal corticosteroid administration for premature preterm rupture of membranes or twins were more likely to deliver at<34 weeks' gestation. However, the study also suggests that women who received antenatal corticosteroid administration for preterm rupture of membranes or twins were more likely to remain pregnant for a longer period."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that fibromyalgia is more common in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome who complain of fatigue. However, the study also suggests that the prevalence of fibromyalgia is higher in patients with secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome."}

{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene is a candidate for schizophrenia, as it shows significant differences in allele frequencies and sex-specific interactions between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is clinically relevant, as it shows a better discrimination between independent ambulation in 1-year post injury compared to the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with schizophrenia showed significant decreases in whole brain volume, whole brain gray matter, frontal gray matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter, as well as larger increases in lateral ventricular volume, over time. The time between baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans ranged from 1 to 10 years. The differences between patients and control subjects in annualized percentage volume change were -.07% for whole brain volume, -.59% for whole brain gray matter, -.32% for frontal white matter, -.32% for parietal white matter, -.39% for temporal white matter, and +.36% for bilateral lateral ventricles."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively are associated with an increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, with a median ISF trough concentration of 40.7 mg/L and plasma peak concentration of 13.6 mg/L. However, the ISF penetration is lower than that of meropenem, with a median ISF trough concentration of 63% and a plasma elimination t1/2 of 3.7 h."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is an early stage of the disease, with a 5-year survival of 63%. However, the presence of negative resection margins and positive bronchial resection margins are significant prognostic factors."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Gout patients do not know their serum urate goal, but they do know the importance of achieving and maintaining it. The knowledge is associated with self-reported global health status, but not with self-reported health-related quality of life or gout-specific health status."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded low-income vision care programs improve the utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals, particularly in terms of basic expenses such as food, transportation, and accommodation."}

{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "Frozen section analysis does not alter the surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease, as it does not alter the diagnosis of thyroid cancer."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared to younger ones, with financial-insurance information being the most frequently requested need and the need for intimacy and support being the most common."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "Globulomaxillary cysts are not a new entity, but rather a subset of cystic lesions that can be misdiagnosed as globulomaxillary cysts due to their clinical, radiological, and histological similarities."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that fear of recurrence is a significant predictor of fear of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors, with a higher level of fear being associated with a higher likelihood of developing fears."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials have a poor prognosis, with a higher risk of complications, longer hospital stays, and greater decline in functional status. However, older adults with more symptoms had a higher likelihood of admission and complications."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with a significant improvement in sleep quality, quality of life, and overall life quality parameters. However, the study also identified some challenges in CPAP initiation and acceptance by these patients."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income program reduces disability in the elderly, as indicated by a decrease in mobility limitations."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study identified several clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, including global loss of passive range of movement, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements. However, the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "The use of cough and cold medicines in young children following the 2007 FDA warnings is still a concern, with a significant number of patients and caregivers incorrectly administering the medications."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin C can prevent the development of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, as evidenced by a lower prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome and early cast-related complaints."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a tendency to plate clear is a risk factor for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The use of empiric chest radiography in febrile patients with sickle cell disease is not a reliable predictor of clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome."}

{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the school food policy at Dutch primary schools is not fully implemented and that parents' perceptions of the school food policy may be influenced by the school's lack of clear rules and the lack of enforcement."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that schizophrenia patients have a motion perception deficit, which may be due to the presence of eye-tracking abnormalities. However, the study also suggests that regular eye-tracking performance may be beneficial for control subjects, but not for patients."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer, as measured by the Cleveland Clinic Continence Score. However, the continence score was slightly but not significantly worse in patients with anastomotic leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is associated with a lower neurological outcome in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) compared to those without OPLL. However, the study did not find a significant difference in ASIA motor score between the OPLL+ and OPLL- groups."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences are associated with height, with a negative correlation between waist circumference and height in men and a negative correlation between hip circumference and height in women."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a prevalence of approximately 50% and a 6-month prevalence of 75.5%. The most common complaints are low back pain, headache, shoulder and neck pain, and affective disorders. The most frequent diagnoses are depression, past admissions to psychiatric hospitals, and impairment and unfitness for work. Impairment and unfitness for work are related to specific psychiatric diagnoses."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies compared to younger adults and non-English speaking patients. However, personality disorder did not significantly predict coping strategies."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of cervical cord plaques and cervical discopathy are significantly associated with each other."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "The presence of high-grade fibrosis and an elevated AST/ALT ratio in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are associated with a higher likelihood of being diagnosed as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the MCV and AST/ALT ratio are also important predictors of high-grade fibrosis."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, immediate breast reconstruction can compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, as evidenced by a higher complication rate, more seromas, and longer time to chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The inverse equity hypothesis holds true for cancer screening coverage in middle-income countries, with lower economic inequalities in screening participation being observed in countries with higher aggregate coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The use of antibiotics in tonsillectomy is not associated with a decrease in post-tonsillectomy morbidity."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring in clinical psychiatry is a feasible and effective method for monitoring depression severity, with a high degree of acceptance and acceptance by psychiatrists."}

{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme is a clinically and cost-effective programme for basic foot care in the elderly, with a high success rate of physical ability testing. However, the study did not find a statistically significant difference in physical ability between patients who passed all the physical tests and those who failed them."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and all-cause mortality is not significantly influenced by spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship."}

However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not provide evidence that unsafe sexual behaviour is increasing among HIV-infected individuals over time. The study did not find a significant increase in reported unsafe sex over time."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cytostatic treatment is an independent predictor of improved survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma patients, particularly in those with ECOG scores of 0 to 1. However, the study also suggests that weight loss and symptomatic treatment may also be significant prognostic factors."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures.

{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year of radical prostatectomy is a predictor of outcome in prostate cancer, as indicated by a significant association between the year of radical prostatectomy and improved preoperative and postoperative outcomes."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "The study found that women with a prior major depression history had a lower risk of developing major depression during midlife compared to those without a history. However, the risk profiles differed between those with and without a history. Being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and prior anxiety disorders were predominant risk factors for first lifetime-onset major depression."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Early extubation is a feasible and effective strategy for children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery, including neonates, who are at risk for delayed extubation. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant difference in mortality or complications between early and delayed extubation."}

The syndrome is characterized by clandestine and elusive practices, including autoerotic asphyxiation, which can lead to unintended death."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that STIR imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T can be used as a complementary tool to conventional T1-weighted imaging for the detection of bone metastases. However, the sensitivity of STIR at 1.5 T was lower than that of T1w at both field strengths, and the specificity was lower at 3 T. The study also noted a significant improvement in lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation, and image quality on STIR compared to T1w at both field strengths."}

{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity is a significant predictor of where people with cancer die, with the UK being the most common country of birth for BAME groups and Asia and Africa being the most common geographical regions."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have a higher likelihood of having a Lynch syndrome diagnosis compared to women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary without a family history of cancer."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns.

{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "The use of local anesthesia for MR arthrography of the shoulder is associated with a lower pain intensity compared to no local anesthesia. However, the study did not find a significant difference in pain intensity between men and women."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "The use of a nasobiliary drainage tube after endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones is associated with a shorter procedure time and a higher discomfort score in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the recurrence rate or length of hospital stay between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "Nasal polyposis is an autosomal dominant condition, with a high prevalence of affected individuals and a high risk of developing the condition. The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant, with a high risk of developing the condition in the presence of a specific genetic mutation."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "Emergency double-balloon enteroscopy combined with real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy can be a feasible combined approach in acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, with a higher detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesion and a higher success rate in managing the lesions."}

{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Patients in the new wave of community-based medical education in regional and rural Australia are overwhelmingly positive about their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching and feel they themselves play an important role in the consultation process. However, they are also apprehensive about allowing students to conduct some or all aspects of the consultation independently."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population.

However, the effect sizes are small."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "Immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the anal canal can provide valuable information regarding the presence and location of estrogen and progesterone receptors. The study suggests that estrogen receptors are present in smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter, perimuscular connective tissue, and perimuscular connective tissue in all females, and in striated muscle cells of the external sphincter in all males. The presence of estrogen receptors in perimuscular connective tissue in females is likely due to the presence of estrogen receptors in the perimuscular connective tissue. The presence of progesterone receptors in striated muscle cells of the external sphincter in males is likely due to the presence of progesterone receptors in the perimuscular connective tissue."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling improves the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence, as evidenced by a significant improvement in the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity (OAB-q SS) score 6 weeks after surgery."}

However, blind subjects were less accurate and inaccurate under the hearing only condition."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "The scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes is a safe and effective approach, with a low conversion rate and low postoperative complications. However, it is important to note that the study did not specifically address the conversion rate to laparoscopy."}

However, the side effects are often uncomplicated and may lead to poor central vision."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a pressor is necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest, as evidenced by increased aortic pressures and increased coronary perfusion pressures."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers.
