{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preresidency selection criteria predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency, with a moderate linear correlation between preresidency selection criteria and objective measures of resident knowledge and performance, and a weak correlation between preresidency selection criteria and subjective outcomes such as AOA membership and global evaluation scores."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone.

{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "No, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine does not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."}

{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation may exist. The mutation identified in the KCNQ1 gene, R14C, is associated with a high prevalence of hypertension and may play a role in the development of atrial fibrillation. The study found that the mutant protein, KCNE1, can be expressed in CHO cells and showed no significant differences in channel kinetics after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin, suggesting that the mutation does not affect the function of the channel. However, the study also found that the mutant protein showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration after"}

{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity is a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse, with a high concentration of fentanyl in the post-mortem analysis suggesting a rapid onset of respiratory arrest."}

{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors, with pleomorphic adenomas showing higher ADC values than other entities."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "Yes, UK radiologists are satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with only a small percentage of departments (15%) having a dedicated paediatric radiologist."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity.

{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that behavioral risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol intake, and waist circumference, are responsible for the conversion from optimal blood pressure (BP) to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the two samples of gay men living with HIV differed in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptoms. The Web-based sample was more likely to report higher physical symptom burden, while the clinic sample was less likely to report being in the upper tertile of psychological symptoms."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. The study found that the initial contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and the pelvis ranged from 11-17 cm(2) at 1 year postoperatively, with a median proximal migration of 0.83 mm and sagittal rotation of 1.3\u00b0."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cardiac reoperations in octogenarians are associated with improved functional status and quality of life, as measured by the Barthel Index and New York Heart Association class."}

{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, open access endoscopy can close the door to an adequately informed patient, as the study found that patients who underwent outpatient endoscopic procedures in a GI subspecialty clinic were more likely to receive more detailed information and explanation than those referred from a general practice."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that uterine myomas grow during pregnancy, with a significant decrease in volume observed between the first and second study periods."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The association between birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood is not confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, double reading of barium enemas is necessary, as the study found that adding a second reader increased the number of positive results and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in patients with colorectal cancer."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications. The study found that the VMPA to the TMJ was effective in improving access and decreasing complications, including fewer incisions and a faster recovery."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "No, routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer surgery. The study found that the metastasis rate of station 9 nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations, and the staging results of most patients would not be impaired even if station 9 nodes were not dissected."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant change in trend in the prescription claims of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) following the FDA warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records.

Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught using a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in Rhineland-Palatinate."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in profiling quality of care, as the reliability of implicit review is significantly higher for chronic disease conditions such as diabetes and hypertension compared to other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute conditions."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failed intrauterine devices (IUD) insertions are a significant problem in community practice, with a higher likelihood of unsuccessful insertions in nulliparous women compared to parous women."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable, as the study found that the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production was reduced by over $1,000 compared to using traditional methods."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, there were no differences in the effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion does not change after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The study found that laser treatment significantly increased the peak levels of lidocaine in the serum, with a peak level of 0.62 mg/L observed at 250 \u00b5m, compared to 0.45 mg/L, 0.48 mg/L, and 0.3 mg/L at other depths."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines.

{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer, as there was no significant difference in tumour size reduction or local failure between the groups with and without p53 alterations."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) therapy may be a useful treatment option for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in patients who are at higher risk of mortality and morbidity. The mortality rate among patients who received HBO therapy was significantly lower compared to those who received surgical excision and antibiotics alone."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients can be treated with higher doses of zonisamide, with a success rate of 55% in this study."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). The study found that patients with high Ki-67 expression had poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with lower Ki-67 expression. Additionally, multivariate analysis suggested that Ki-67 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CSS and DFS in UTUC patients."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population.

{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery or radiation therapy significantly improves survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers (EPSCC) compared to those who undergo surgery and/or radiation alone."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy is related to pylorus preservation, as evidenced by the higher incidence of postoperative complications in the group where postoperative complications occurred (71%) compared to the group where no postoperative complications occurred (36%)."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP)."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, c-kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target, as inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the proto-oncogene c-kit can lead to cell death."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "No, all human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with end-stage renal disease should not be excluded from transplantation. The survey suggests that transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease is not a priority among transplant centers in the United States, and that transplantation in the face of HIV infection may be harmful to the individual."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "Yes, staging laparoscopy (SL) is useful in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for assessing extensive disease or metastases, but it is not routinely performed for all patients. The study found that SL was unsuccessful in 7.1% of patients, and the procedure was associated with unresectability in 13% of cases. Additionally, the study found that SL was associated with a higher rate of additional unresectable tumors and cirrhosis in the contralateral liver, leading to a lower yield of SL and a higher accuracy of diagnosis."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as it can improve the accuracy of pathologic reporting and improve the accuracy of risk assessment and treatment."}

{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "No, the central venous pressure does not predict fluid responsiveness. The summary correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), being 0.28 (95% CI, 0.16-0.40) in the ICU patients, and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02-0.21) in the operating room patients."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, D-dimer can become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis, as it can be a useful tool for detecting acute appendicitis in patients with a history of pain."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death. The study found that mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during developmental regulated PCD, with a significant decrease in mitochondrial dynamics observed in lace plant leaves during early stages of PCD, and a significant increase in mitochondrial dynamics observed in lace plant leaves during late stages of PCD."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Transurethral catheterisation is not the ideal method of bladder drainage for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, as male patients were more dissatisfied than female patients with the procedure."}

{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical predictors are not adequate in the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, with minor changes in nutrients observed over a 7-year period."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with a higher likelihood of patella eversion in knee flexion position compared to patella reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA, as shown by the study's findings in hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs."}

The study found that patients with MS had higher levels of antistreptolysin O (ASO) and lower levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) compared to healthy blood donors."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is the expression of immune dysregulation, as it is characterized by the presence of lung nodules and a biopsy of a pulmonary lesion showing all the signs of organizing pneumonia (OP)."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women who received antenatal corticosteroid (AC) for premature preterm rupture of membranes (PTMR) or twins were more likely to deliver at <34 weeks of gestation compared to those who received AC for other reasons."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) who complain of fatigue have a higher prevalence of fibromyalgia (FM) compared to those with secondary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (sSS)."}

{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "No, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene is not a candidate for schizophrenia."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is clinically relevant, as it can help identify patients who are more likely to be able to achieve independent ambulation 1 year post injury. The use of only voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 light touch (LT) sensory score showed a better discrimination between patients with incomplete SCI and those with complete SCI, with a higher PPV and NPV."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, with significant decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter volume, and white matter volume over time."}

{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are equivalent to the plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is a relatively early stage disease, with a 5-year survival rate of 63%. In both univariate and multivariate survival analysis, significant prognostic factors were histology, tumor size, and the presence of negative resection margin. However, in the multivariate analysis, the presence of negative resection margin was found to be a significant prognostic factor."}

{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms do matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials, as older adults with more symptoms are more likely to experience complications, decline in functional status, and have higher rates of admission, complication, and decline in functional status."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea appears to offer a better quality of life and better sleep compared to other therapies."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program reduces disability in the elderly, with a significant increase in the rate of mobility limitations among those aged 65 and older."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis are real, and that they can help identify patients who may benefit from pain relief."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concerns remain regarding the use of cough and cold medicines in young children after the FDA warnings were issued in 2007. The study found that only a small proportion of children (only 53%) demonstrated that they would treat with cough or cold medicines, and only 72% correctly dosed their desired medication."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin C can prevent the development of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures. The study found that the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was significantly lower in patients who received vitamin C compared to those who received a placebo."}

{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are opportunities for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools, with a majority of principals and teachers believing that the school has a written food policy and that the rules are not clearly defined, and that parents are primarily responsible to encourage healthy eating habits among children. However, parents' opinion on the enforcement of the school food policy varies, with a majority of parents believing that the school should enforce the policy more strongly and have no opinion on this topic."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the motion perception deficit in schizophrenia patients is a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "No significant relationship was found between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation in the study population."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "No, anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer, as there was no difference in continence function between patients with anastomotic leakage and those without complications."}

{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences are associated with height, with higher values associated with taller heights."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a prevalence of about 50% and a 6-month prevalence of 75.5% among patients with psychiatric disorders. The most common complaints are low back pain, headache, and shoulder and neck pain. Patients with affective, neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders are most frequently affected, followed by those with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. The study found that almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past year. Impairment and unfitness for work are related to specific psychiatric diagnosis, with depression and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals being significant risk factors."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients. Older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies compared to younger adults, and this difference was observed across different personality disorders."}

{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that context does matter for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality, with the main spatial regression result indicating that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the majority of variability in outcome attributable to therapists in the Veterans Affairs posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic was due to therapists' characteristics, rather than the implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in practice."}

{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between patient and physician assessment of quality of life (QoL) in the study. The weighted kappa analysis showed relatively poor concordance between patient and physician responses, with a mean kappa of 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57)."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, accompanying metabolic syndrome (MetS) contributes to heart dimensions in hypertensive patients. The study found that patients with MetS had increased interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left ventricular mass, compared to those without MetS."}

{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased use of private health care is associated with a reduction in the demand for NHS care, as evidenced by lower private referral rates and higher NHS referral rates in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared to the least deprived fifth."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no association between skewed X-inactivation and recurrent spontaneous abortion in a large, well-defined sample of women with recurrent loss."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "No, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes does not improve the management of pain at the end of life."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that trainees in an academic vascular department are able to provide complete surgical care for patients, with a higher rate of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision-making process observed in emergent cases."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia.

The risk of death was significantly lower in patients who received outpatient cardiology clinic visits compared to those who did not receive these visits, and this difference was observed in both the primary and follow-up cohorts."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an intrauterine influence on obesity, with higher maternal BMI levels being associated with higher offspring BMI levels."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients is marginally acceptable, with a significant increase in left ventricular dysfunction observed in those with a low FAC."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a lethal outcome, with a high prevalence of fatalities and a high mortality rate. The study found that AEA can be a clandestine and elusive practice, with a high prevalence of clandestine practices among young patients, and that AEA practitioners can miscalculate the peril of the situation they have contrived, and lose their gamble with death."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T.

{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "Yes, immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the anal canal can have implications for anal incontinence. The study found that estrogen receptors were present in smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter of all females, and in perimuscular connective tissue in males. Additionally, the study found that only one patient exhibited staining for progesterone receptors, and this was confined to the smooth muscle. These findings suggest that immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the anal canal may have implications for anal incontinence."}
