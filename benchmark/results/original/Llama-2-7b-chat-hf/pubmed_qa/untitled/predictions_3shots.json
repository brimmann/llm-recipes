{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "Yes, eligibility for an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer, as demonstrated by improved overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and reduced risk of cancer-related death in the protocol group compared to the non-protocol group."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis may not be worth the additional cost of radiation and time, as the majority of patients (95.8%) did not have any additional beneficial findings in the delayed phase. However, in a small number of patients (4.2%), incidental findings were detected in the delayed phase that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "No, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments in individuals with brain tumors."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "Yes, it is possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, but the rate of virological relapse is high, with 54.54% of patients experiencing a relapse within 6 months after discontinuation."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the diameter of the aneurysm is important in determining the influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture. The study found that larger aneurysms (>7 cm) were more likely to rupture in cases where the atmospheric pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture, with a trend towards a higher rupture rate in patients with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the sternal skin conductance (SSC) device may not be a reliable measure of hot flashes, with a concordance rate of only 24% between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. Therefore, it is unlikely that the SSC device can be considered a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip is not cost-effective for a 79-year-old woman, but it can be a cost-effective method for certain subgroups of patients, such as women aged 71-75 years with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, or women younger than age 70 years. However, the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation is highly sensitive to the effectiveness and relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preresidency selection criteria can predict performance in orthopaedic surgery residency. Specifically, objective measures of resident knowledge and performance, such as USMLE Step 2 scores and ABOS Part I scores, are moderately correlated with preresidency selection criteria. Subjective ratings by faculty, such as global evaluation scores and faculty rankings, are also influenced by preresidency selection criteria, with AOA membership being associated with higher scores in these areas."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that baseline antral follicle assessment may be a better predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome than maternal age and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle >6 compared to those with antral follicle < or = 6, even after controlling for patient age and basal FSH levels. Additionally, the cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle < or = 6 compared to those with antral follicle > or = 6"}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "No, feeding tube insertion and its timing do not improve survival in advanced cognitive impairment patients."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge newborns are less likely to have adequate metabolic screening specimens compared to traditional stay newborns, but are more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant benefit in terms of overall survival for palliative lung cancer patients who receive high-dose radiotherapy (50 Gy in 20 fractions) compared to those who receive lower dose radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 fractions)."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis in the elderly population, and therefore, leukocyte and CRP measurements do not have a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in this age group."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, desflurane alters left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery, as evidenced by an increase in afterload, end-systolic wall stress, and left ventricular stroke work index."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Approximately 23% of adult patients with celiac disease (CD) who have been on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for 20 years or more have developed tolerance to gluten, as evidenced by the absence of immunological or histological signs of CD in the small intestine."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers in a rural region of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, are not entirely appropriate in the South African context. The study revealed several nutritional inadequacies in the replacement milks, including low levels of certain micronutrients and essential fatty acids. Additionally, the preparation times and costs of the home-prepared replacement milks were found to be more feasible than the commercial formula. However, the study did note that the commercial formula provided more adequate amounts of certain nutrients, such as vitamins A"}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) appear to have a significant effect on the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients, particularly in those with obstruction who are treated with ICSs."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acceptance rates of a national preventive home visit program for older people are socially imbalanced, with older people from higher socioeconomic backgrounds being more likely to accept the program than those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a correlation between androgens and sexual desire in women, although the correlation is not strong and varies depending on age and other factors."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, comorbidity between major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes of MD in adulthood, after adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no statistically significant difference in target motion between the superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume (PB-CTV) in the study population."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, octogenarians (patients aged 80-89 years) are considered high-risk for carotid endarterectomy due to the presence of associated risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and history of smoking."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is synergy between lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine in suppressing T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens in mice."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are gender differences in the effects of exercise training on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals. Exercise training lowers heart rate and increases heart rate variability in both men and women, but the effect on the QT/RR slope is more pronounced in women."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "No, base deficit does not predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the paper suggests that syncope during bathing in infants can be a form of water-induced urticaria, specifically aquagenic urticaria. The study found that all six infants in the study had dermographism, and there was an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in two of the infants. The evolution of the \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after a few weeks without baths, but three out of seven infants continued to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water after a 2-7 year follow-up."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity, as evidenced by the significant increase in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in patients who underwent the procedure."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjustment for reporting heterogeneity is necessary in sleep disorders. The study found that after adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems, while sex was no longer a significant factor."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sex does affect the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Male patients have a higher conversion rate, longer operating time, and a higher incidence of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforation, and gallstone spillage compared to female patients."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, fluoroscopy is not essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones in this study population. Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 94.2% of patients."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surrogates of injury severity, specifically length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU, and the use of external radiation beam therapy (XRT), are significantly associated with the development and severity of heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "No, the study does not suggest that epidural analgesia is a risky technique for surgical treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis. The study found no instances of spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess in the patients who received epidural analgesia. Additionally, there were no significant changes in blood coagulation or leukocyte counts in the patients who received epidural analgesia."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that technology alone may not be sufficient to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, as the improvement in HbA1c levels was only observed in high users who also received telemonitoring and teleconsultation."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early outcome measures of mammographic screening are influenced by ethnicity. The Sami population had a lower attendance rate and recall rate in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program compared to the control group, and a lower percentage of breast cancers were detected in the NBCSP among the Sami population."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "No, ganglionated plexi ablation during the Maze IV procedure does not appear to be beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that serum pancreatic lipase may be a more accurate biomarker than serum amylase for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for serum pancreatic lipase was higher than that for serum amylase, indicating better diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, a lower proportion of acute pancreatitis patients had elevated serum pancreatic lipase compared to serum amylase, suggesting that serum pancreatic lipase may be more specific for the diagnosis. Therefore, based on the results of this study, it may be reasonable to consider replacing serum amylase with ser"}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, per-oral transgastric splenectomy is technically feasible using a flexible endoscope."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a higher blood pressure difference between arms can predict the severity of subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). In this study, patients with complete reversal or alternating flow in the vertebral artery waveform had higher blood pressure differences between arms compared to those with systolic deceleration waveform."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) from minimally conscious state (MCS) patients. The study found that a-tDCS can boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all healthy individuals, MCS patients, and can even unmask excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that lay people and health professionals in France generally find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease, with lay people and psychologists being more accepting of this breach than physicians."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, medical students in the study met the national standards for clinical encounters of selected core conditions in emergency medicine. On average, students saw 8.4 of the 10 core conditions during their 4-week clerkship, with 15.4% seeing all 10 conditions and 76.9% seeing at least 8."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "Bile duct sludge (BDS) is not as clinically significant as bile duct stones (CBD stones) in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nasogastric decompression is useful in preventing staple line leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. The study found that the incidence of staple line leaks was significantly lower in the group that underwent nasogastric decompression during the procedure."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic sonography (LUS) is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer, particularly for evaluating hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% compared to preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy. However, it has a low specificity (53%) for nodal metastases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "No, the results of the study suggest that IBS is not a diagnosis of exclusion. Experts were less likely to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion compared to nonexperts, and experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS and perform fewer tests."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The radiographic transition zone on contrast enema does not have a strong correlation with the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease, with an agreement rate of 58.1% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.39."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, signs of spinal cord involvement, such as the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) on MRI, are associated with a poorer neurological recovery in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA)."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness (SD) does not necessarily progress to Meniere's disease. While some patients with low-tone SD may experience recurrent hearing loss and vertigo, the majority of patients with a single episode of low-tone SD do not develop Meniere's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that ACE-1 gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, visual loss due to amblyopia is not permanent. The study found that in 9 out of 12 cases of improved visual acuity in amblyopic eyes, the improvement occurred within 1-12 months and remained stable over the period of follow-up."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "Yes, correlated results are possible when using homebrew assays for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR, as demonstrated by the strong correlation (r(s) = 0.9435, p < 0.00001) observed in the study between the results obtained at two different laboratories using different methods."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the case report suggests that spinal subdural hematoma can be a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, specifically a subarachnoid hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, LAA occlusion device alters echocardiography and electrocardiogram parameters in patients with atrial fibrillation, with a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis observed after device implantation, as well as significant differences in heart rate and mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation. However, there were no significant differences in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation, but a larger LA diameter was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months, and a larger ARD was also observed during follow-up at 12 months than the baseline dimension in pre-operation"}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "No, untethering is not necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele, based on the study's findings."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "No, pulp chamber pulpotomy should not be seen as a permanent treatment, as the survival rate of the treated teeth at 24 months was only 82%."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in early outcomes between patients who had endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) for small saphenous varicose veins with access gained above or below the mid-calf level."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a finding of retinal haemorrhages after a convulsive episode should prompt further investigation to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Global Longitudinal Pathway (GLP) medical education curriculum has influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, it appears that a small percentage (1.3%) of colorectal cancers may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can be a successful second chance for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft. The study found that second pancreas survival was close to primary graft survival and significantly better than the first pancreas survival, regardless of the cause of first pancreas loss. Additionally, survival of second simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations was better than survival of second pancreas after kidney transplantation. Overall, pancreas retransplantation had no impact on kidney graft function and survival."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study finds that hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends, as evidenced by lower rates of immediate intensive cardiac procedures and higher rates of adverse health outcomes among weekend-admitted patients compared to weekday-admitted patients."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "No, the presence of multiple viruses does not significantly correlate with the severity of acute respiratory infection in children. However, bacterial superinfection is associated with increased severity, and pneumococcal vaccination is found to be a protective factor in terms of respiratory distress, PICU admission, clinical score, respiratory support requirement, and oxygen necessity."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "No, delayed surgery (ETA > 8 hours) was not found to be a significant predictor of increased complications in patients with acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "No, fetal gender is not associated with emergency department visits for asthma during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that rotator cuff tears are more common among males working in certain occupations, particularly those in agriculture and forestry, and the building industry."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the zero central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate achieved in the NICU of the Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center is sustainable. The study found that ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion and maintenance practices, as well as improved documentation, were key drivers of success in maintaining the low CLABSI rate over a 1-year period."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that atropine is not necessary when using ketamine for sedation in children, as atropine did not provide any additional benefits in terms of hypersalivation or side effect profile compared to placebo. In fact, atropine was associated with a higher incidence of transient rash. Therefore, based on this study, it may be reasonable to omit atropine when using ketamine for sedation in children."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "No, wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation (PNA) are not equivalent concepts. While there is a significant correlation between the two, they are distinct and can be differentiated through factor analysis."}

While players tend to believe that headgear can prevent concussion, coaches are less convinced. Only a minority of players reported wearing headgear, and few felt that its use should be made mandatory."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "No, early postoperative oral intake does not have to be limited to laparoscopy. The study found that patients who underwent laparotomy (an open surgical procedure) were able to resume regular food intake after resolution of ileus, which occurred at a similar rate as in the laparoscopy group."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) are associated with steep posterior tibial slopes, specifically a medial PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 and a lateral PTS \u2265 5\u00b0. The odds ratio of ACLR failure was 6.8 for medial PTS \u2265 5\u00b0 and 10.8 for lateral PTS \u2265 5\u00b0."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of elderly patients correctly endorsed their intention to call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke, and only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "No, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy is not necessary, as pneumothorax occurs in only 2.9% of cases and symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax are present in only 7% of cases."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The study found that early administration of surfactant within one hour of birth was associated with a lower rate of chronic lung disease (CLD) and mortality before/at 36 weeks, but had little or no impact on CLD/mortality after adjusting for other variables."}

{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment, as shown by the increased concordance index (c-index) values in the Cox proportional hazards models and random survival forests."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "Continuing oral hypoglycemic agents in addition to starting insulin therapy appears to be associated with a lower rate of treatment failure and less weight gain compared to starting insulin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as it has high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy, and a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects compared to other atypical antipsychotics, as shown in the study."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine (0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 or 1:400,000 epinephrine) impairs uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes, decreasing it to 68 +/- 14% of baseline."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma may play a crucial factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) has the potential to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF SPECT in differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls."}

{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is no evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL staining or typical apoptotic changes in nuclear morphology in the temporal lobe specimens from patients with mesial temporal sclerosis, suggesting that the cell death in this condition is not primarily apoptotic."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate between MiraLAX and Golytely, with a higher rate of adenoma detection detected in the Golytely group."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "No, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp cannot predict a neoplastic polyp. According to the study, older age and larger size of the polyp are significantly associated with neoplastic polyps, but the growth rate is not."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that a stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation may play a role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation, linking genetic and environmental factors."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes.

It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "No significant difference in the prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection was seen, indicating that host immune response to gonorrhea does not provide limited serovar-specific protection from reinfection."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, viral infections play a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that there is a role for cytokines in epilepsy. The levels of certain cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6) were found to be elevated in the serum of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there was a correlation between certain demographic factors (male gender, positive family history, and alcohol use) and cytokine levels. Furthermore, serial analysis during the seizure-free period revealed a decrease in cytokine levels in some patients. These findings suggest that cytokines may play a role in the pathophysiology of epile"}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) do matter, with differences in operative time, length of stay, and postoperative outcomes."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is complex and depends on various factors. Our analysis suggests that withholding anticoagulation therapy may be the preferred option for patients with a history of lobar ICH, as it can improve quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, for patients with a history of deep hemispheric ICH, the gain in QALYs is smaller, at 0.3 QALYs. Sensitivity analyses suggest that"}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "No, (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia, as there is a decreasing similarity between its distribution and that of the tracer (14)C-EF3 under hypoxic conditions."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are secondary benefits of treadmill training for people in the chronic stage of recovery from stroke, including improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Yes, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment to severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health service makes a significant difference in terms of mortality and hospital length of stay. Patients who presented to a level III trauma center had a higher risk of death compared to those who presented to a level I center, after controlling for various factors such as age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and prehospital time. Additionally, peer review of deaths at the level III center identified problems in care delivery in 15 cases, including technical errors, delay in decision making, and errors of judgment."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. Only 6 out of 43 genes showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is unlikely to cope effectively with the increased incidence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) related adverse effects resulting from the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). The region faces significant challenges in terms of poverty, weak health systems, inadequate health services, lack of qualified personnel, and inaccessibility to medicines, which will exacerbate the situation. Additionally, there is a lack of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, making it difficult to prepare an adequate response plan."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity could be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse, as the study found that rapid intravenous administration of fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "No, women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS do not benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF in terms of increasing live birth rates or reducing severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rates."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask (BVM). The study found that the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes compared to the adult BVM in all three categories of airway devices, with a significant difference in all scenarios (p<0.001). Only 1.5% of breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM were below the recommended tidal volume, while a greater percentage of breaths were delivered in the recommended range when the pediatric BVM was used."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "No, a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not significantly affect its management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "The current evidence suggests that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, but more research is needed to confirm this for patients with type 1 diabetes."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet may lead to behavioral adaptation and changes in driving behavior among drivers."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the length, number, and total duration of clinical supervision sessions were significantly positively correlated with the effectiveness of clinical supervision, suggesting that more frequent and longer supervision sessions may be more effective in improving clinical supervision effectiveness. Additionally, having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor and having a completed clinical supervision agreement were also associated with higher total MCSS-26 scores. These findings suggest that clinical supervision can be an effective mechanism for supporting and developing the skills of allied health professionals, particularly when it is of a sufficient duration and frequency, and when professionals have some say in the allocation of their supervisor."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain aspects of social exclusion, specifically the \"economic/employment\" and \"social/welfare\" dimensions, are significantly associated with suicide mortality in both males and females in Europe."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ultrasound examination is a useful addition to clinical staging in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in assessing the extent of invasion into the corpora."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "Health care providers, including house staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners, have varying levels of proficiency in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers, with respiratory care practitioners being the most knowledgeable. However, a significant percentage of patients also have a poor understanding of the technique used with metered-dose inhalers."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "No, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebral level) does not always coincide with the coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The study found that the regional and global apex levels were at the same level in 54.5% of curves, within half a level in 45.4%, and one level higher in 2% of curves."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample does not generalize well to the diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder, as it has a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality compared to the \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" sample obtained through consecutive new case ascertainment."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a broad consensus among country experts in Europe on the principles of good practice for health care for immigrants, including easy and equal access to health care, empowerment of migrants, culturally sensitive health care services, quality of care, patient/health care provider communication, respect towards migrants, networking in and outside health services, targeted outreach activities, and availability of data about specificities in migrant health care and prevention. However, there are also some discordances within and between countries on certain factors, such as the need for prioritizing cultural differences and the need for more consistent governance of health care services for immigrants."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) is present in cervical disk disease."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, training at an intensity that feels \"good\" through affect-regulated exercise leads to improved fitness, specifically an increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, over an 8-week training program."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatitis G virus and TT virus infection between patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease and those with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatic complaints (assessed using the SCL-90-R somatization subscale) predict subsequent symptoms of depressed mood in women, but not in men, in an initially healthy cohort of community adults."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early respiratory predictors such as peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index can predict outcome in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that inhibin may be a useful new circulating marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole. The concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue were found to be significantly higher in patients with hydatidiform mole compared to normal pregnant women, and the levels decreased significantly after evacuation of the mole. Additionally, none of the patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. These findings suggest that inhibin may be a useful marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of hydatidiform mole."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be necessary for diagnostic accuracy in MR-mammography, it can provide additional information that may be useful in certain cases."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylactic shock is a significant discouragement for surgeons in adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for several adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "No, only 13.6% of pregnant women with major depression were identified through both dispensing claims and hospital admission data, suggesting that the majority of women with depression during pregnancy may not be captured in population health data."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the manic/mixed episode distinction in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time, as episodes are more likely to be consistent (all manic or all mixed) than would be expected by chance."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "Yes, general practice characteristics are associated with uptake of an IT innovation in primary care, specifically the number of diabetes-educated staff in the practice."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "Yes, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration, discrimination, and accuracy in predicting admission at triage, with an AUC of 0.876 for GAPS compared to 0.810 for VAS (p=0.001). When clinical certainty was \u226595%, GAPS significantly outperformed either method, with an AUC of 0.891 (0.877-0.907) and accuracy of 82.5% (80.7%-84.2%)."}

{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "No, the patient in the medical paper does not have Crohn's disease. The patient is described as having rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different inflammatory condition."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this study found that individuals with better health behaviors (such as regular exercise, healthy diet, and regular blood pressure measurement) have lower utilization of healthcare resources, as measured by the number of outpatient visits and health examinations."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "No, managed care does not enable more low-income persons to identify a usual source of care. In fact, high managed care penetration in the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of care for uninsured persons."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Yes, topical ropivacaine hydrochloride reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients, with a statistically significant difference in pain control observed in the first hour after surgery, and continued significance in subsequent hours and days."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, minimally invasive mitral valve repair with artificial chords is reproducible and applicable in routine surgery, with a high repair rate and low complication rate."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio is a better way to compare different bioprostheses, as it takes into account the individual patient's anatomy and valve dimensions, rather than just the prosthesis size."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women were more likely than men to delay seeking medical help due to reasons related to social and cultural factors, such as being alone when symptoms began and not having someone to advise them to seek medical attention."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "Yes, alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a forerunner to bronchiectasis in children with protracted bacterial bronchitis."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy significantly improves tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST)."}

{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence of secular growth acceleration during fetal life, as the study found no statistically significant differences in fetal biometric parameters between the current population and those from 35 years ago."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant association between body mass index and prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age, so it is not necessary to adjust for body mass index when measuring prostate specific antigen."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, 30-day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies is an area of concern and in need of improvement, with a significant difference in mortality rates between patients aged <70 and >70 years."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a probable causative link between the Say-Barber-Miller syndrome and the occurrence of cerebromediastinal tuberculosis in the child described in the medical paper."}

{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no evidence to suggest that episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli, as there were no between-group differences in attentional bias indices for headache or happy facial stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations can predict that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public values interventions that prevent hospital-acquired infections more highly than interventions related to genetic disorders, and less highly than interventions related to lifestyle and sports injuries."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that dose reduction to one parotid gland does not prevent xerostomia in patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancers."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that stopping folic acid supplementation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) established on methotrexate and folic acid may result in increased toxicity, as evidenced by an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group, and may not have a significant impact on the efficacy of methotrexate. Therefore, continuing folic acid supplementation long-term in these patients may be beneficial."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for patients who have residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and continue to experience severe GERD symptoms."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Yes, visceral adipose tissue area measurement at a single level (specifically, 3 cm above the lower margin of L3) can represent visceral adipose tissue volume changes."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cytokeratin immunoreactivity is useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 77.5%, respectively."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae.

{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are likely to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a3482 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. However, there is uncertainty in these results, particularly regarding relapse after birth, and additional research is potentially worthwhile."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital is effective in increasing hospital efficiency and reducing costs, with no adverse events reported and high parental satisfaction."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. These include:"}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "No, the study suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome, but rather a complex and multifaceted condition involving multiple body systems and a range of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In the majority of cases (91.5%), the multidisciplinary team's decisions for breast cancer management were found to be concordant with the subsequent patient management. However, there were 4.5% of decisions that were discordant, with 17.8% of these being considered \"unjustifiable\" as there was no additional information available to explain the change in management."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK, as only 1.6% of the isolates were PVL-positive, but 36% were oxacillin-resistant (methicillin-resistant S. aureus)."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the results of the study suggest that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy by increasing the frequency and duration of positive behaviors, and reducing the frequency and duration of negative behaviors."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the insertion allele (I) of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "Yes, postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in adults with partial seizure disorder."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the postsurgical infection rate."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the majority of emergency medical services (EMS) professionals (82.7%) believe that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention programs."}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients may not be adequate, as only a minority of patients achieved sufficient increases in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with the recommended doses of ergocalciferol."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "No correlation was found between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response in cancer patients."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In a resource-limited setting, it is feasible to maintain HIV viral load suppression over time with treatment as prevention (TasP) strategies, although there is a risk of emergence of viral resistance and compromise of future treatment options."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that pyloric mucosal hypertrophy plays a role in the development of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infants."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain maternal and infant factors are predictive of discordant outcomes in newborns undergoing two-stage screening with TEOAE and AABR."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) at the same centre as the colorectal surgery appears to improve outcomes, including lower mortality rates, lower mean number of procedures, and higher disease-free survival rates at 5 years."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, epiDWI can potentially predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors with a high degree of accuracy, as demonstrated by the significant differences in ADC values between pleomorphic adenomas and other subtypes, including myoepithelial adenomas, Warthin tumors, and salivary duct carcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "UK radiologists are not generally satisfied with the training and support received in suspected child abuse, with only 61% of respondents expressing satisfaction."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis, with lower levels of IL-4 and higher levels of TNFalpha and TNFalpha/IL-4 ratio in the complicated group compared to the uncomplicated group."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "Yes, behavioral risk factors such as smoking, waist circumference, and alcohol intake are significant predictors of the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Web-based sample of gay men living with HIV reported higher levels of psychological symptoms compared to the clinic sample, and being in employment was associated with lower levels of physical symptoms in both samples."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study found that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups does not provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, as evidenced by the high migration rates and limited contact surface between the acetabular component and pelvis observed in the study."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians do not provide significant benefits in terms of survival or quality of life, with a high rate of in-hospital mortality and long-term mortality, and a relatively low level of functional status and quality of life compared to age- and sex-matched normative populations."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiencies in care compared to other patients. Specifically, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder tend to enter nursing homes with more total and healthcare-related deficiencies."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Yes, open access endoscopy may lead to inadequate informed consent and procedure acceptance, as patients in this group reported receiving less information and explanation concerning the nature of the procedure compared to patients referred from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that uterine myomas generally increase in size during pregnancy, with a mean increase in volume of 69% in the second trimester and 102% in the last trimester. However, there is also a significant proportion of myomas that decrease in size during pregnancy, particularly in the first half of pregnancy."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The associations between birth characteristics and low intellectual performance in early adulthood are not significantly confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas does not provide significant additional diagnostic value and may lead to unnecessary alterations in clinical treatment."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications compared to traditional approaches."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer surgery, as the metastasis rate to this station is low (3.45%) and does not significantly impact prognosis."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No significant change in trend in antiepileptic drug (AED) prescription claims was observed after the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "There is a moderate agreement between government records (MTO) and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors, with a kappa coefficient of 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions. Additionally, consulting both sources of data revealed a higher number of accidents and convictions in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught through a structured course model, as demonstrated in this study. The course was found to improve participants' communication skills, including their sense of security in different communication settings and their ability to communicate a diagnosis of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer, or a far progressive cancer disease without curative approach."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-established evidence base. The study found that the reliability of implicit review was higher for conditions with a more developed evidence base, such as diabetes and hypertension, compared to conditions with a less developed evidence base, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a collection of acute conditions. This suggests that peer review can be a useful tool for identifying areas where quality of care may be inconsistent or suboptimal, and for targeting interventions to improve quality of care."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failed IUD insertions are an under-recognized problem in community practice, particularly among nulliparous women."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable, as the time saved during surgery can offset the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, risk factors for suicidal behavior do not differ by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects, including death, amputations, or permanent disability, in the studied population."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The peak levels of lidocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) were significantly higher in the laser-treated skin compared to untreated skin. The optimal ablative depth for enhancing transdermal absorption was found to be 250 \u00b5m."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that there is a weak link in the cold chain for the storage of vaccines in the community, with many practices and clinics not adhering to the recommended storage conditions."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis, as it was found to reduce mortality and the number of surgical d\u00e9bridements required."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) may be effective and well-tolerated in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, with a response rate of 55% and good tolerance to other antiepileptic drugs in the study population of 9 patients."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC). The study found that high Ki-67 expression was associated with muscle-invasive tumors, poorer cancer-specific survival, and disease-free survival in UTUC patients. Additionally, a meta-analysis of the published literature showed that increased Ki-67 levels were associated with poor survival and disease progression in UTUC patients."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "No, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in the knee."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dementia and aphasia are underrecognized associations in motor neuron disease."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation gradually returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting, with a significant recovery of touch threshold values and a decrease in the percentage of patients experiencing paresthesia over time."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders can extend to musical messages, as individuals with hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) showed reduced accuracy in identifying emotions and movements conveyed through music, compared to typically developing children with normal hearing (TD-NH)."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with knee osteoarthritis can use color to describe their pain, with the majority associating high-intensity pain with red and low-intensity pain with colors such as purity, calmness, and happiness. However, there were some limitations and concerns raised regarding the interpretability and standardization of color use for pain description."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "Yes, intensive chemotherapy is safe for rural cancer patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events, such as febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting, between urban and rural patients in the study."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery and radiation therapy have a significant impact on survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers, with improved median, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates observed for patients with gastrointestinal and other extrapulmonary sites."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "No, the incidence of delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pancreaticoduodenectomy is not significantly related to pylorus preservation."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP)."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the expression and phosphorylation of c-kit in uveal melanoma cells suggests that it may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of uveal melanoma. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as STI571, can inhibit c-kit autophosphorylation and result in cell death, with an IC(50) of less than 2.5 microM."}

{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "The majority of responding transplant centers in the US do not support the idea of transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, with the majority of centers requiring HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients and a significant proportion not transplanting an individual who refuses HIV testing."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that staging laparoscopy (SL) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not very useful in determining the resectability of the tumor, with a yield of only 7% and an accuracy of 27%."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that secondary pathology assessments led to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 29% and contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 43% of cases."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "No, vaginal pH cannot be accurately measured from the wet mount slide due to systematic increases in pH caused by the addition of saline, leading to false positive readings."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that oral mucocele/ranula is another HIV-related salivary gland disease, with a higher prevalence among HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The meta-analysis found that the central venous pressure does not have a strong correlation with fluid responsiveness, with a summary AUC of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) and a summary correlation coefficient of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25). The results were similar for studies conducted in the ICU (AUC: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.52-0.58) and operating room (AUC: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.58)."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "No, D-dimer levels did not show a significant difference between histopathologic study groups, and therefore cannot be used as a diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death (PCD). The study found that mitochondrial dynamics, including distribution, motility, and membrane potential, change during PCD in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis). The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation is also involved in PCD, as inhibition of PTP by cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment resulted in fewer perforations in the leaves."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "No, transurethral catheterisation is not the ideal method of bladder drainage, as it is associated with significant discomfort and a higher incidence of urinary tract infections. Male patients in particular are less satisfied with this method and experience more pain during catheterization and removal."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Risk stratification using the MASCC index is useful for predicting the likelihood of severe complications and mortality in gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever, with a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. Inpatient management may be more appropriate for high-risk patients, while outpatient management may be more appropriate for low-risk patients."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic. The study found that the drug caused loss and distortion of inner hair cells, inner phalangeal cells, and spiral ganglia cells in guinea pigs."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are undertreated, particularly those aged 65-74 and 75-84 years old. The analysis showed that these age groups had a significant benefit in disease-specific survival (DSS) with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy compared to younger age groups. However, multivariate analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among the age groups."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in postoperative pain scores or opioid consumption between newborns undergoing thoracoscopic minimal access surgery (MAS) and those undergoing conventional surgery for esophageal atresia (EA) or congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)."}

{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that the nutrient intake of European individuals with type 1 diabetes did not significantly change over a 7-year period, and they did not consume a high atherogenic diet. In fact, there were minor changes in the intake of some nutrients, such as protein, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, which were generally in line with European nutritional recommendations. However, the intake of fibre and saturated fat remained poor."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with patella eversion resulting in smaller gaps in both knee extension and flexion positions compared to patella reduction."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "No, there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even after adjusting for other covariates, suggesting that higher rates of depression in women are not accounted for by differential symptom reporting."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "No, delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer do not significantly impact survival."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low levels of ADMA in young adults born preterm may predict early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the addition of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays to the existing diabetes prediction model significantly improves the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (P<0.0001)."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between past group A streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis (MS), as evidenced by higher levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) in patients with MS compared to healthy controls."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) in children is likely to be an immune-mediated disorder."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the duration of continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid (AC) administration is limited, with only a small percentage of women remaining pregnant beyond 1 week after receiving AC. The likelihood of delivering at<34 weeks is higher for women who received AC for certain conditions, such as premature preterm rupture of membranes, twins, or before 28 weeks. Therefore, the opportunity for rescue AC may be limited in these cases."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant link between fatigue and fibromyalgia (FM) in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS). The prevalence of fatigue is significantly higher in patients with pSS compared to a control group of lupus patients, and a higher proportion of patients with pSS also have FM."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter (UD) is a significant predictor of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "There is suggestive evidence that the HINT1 gene may be a candidate for schizophrenia, although the findings are not yet conclusive."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "No, the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury is not clinically relevant for predicting independent ambulation at 1 year post-injury."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, with significant decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter volume, and white matter volume, and increases in lateral ventricular volume over time."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels (IFG) below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The relative risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality compared to patients with normal fasting blood glucose levels was 1.7 and 2.9, respectively, for patients with IFG."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "Yes, interstitial fluid (ISF) concentrations of meropenem in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) are equivalent to plasma concentrations."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "The prognostic significance of various surgical-pathologic variables in patients with Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) was investigated in the study. The results suggest that histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma), tumor size (<3cm vs >3cm), and the presence of a negative resection margin are significant prognostic factors for overall 5-year survival. However, the prognosis for patients with Stage I NSCLC may not be as favorable as previously thought, as the 5-year survival rate in the study was only 63%."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "Only 14% of gout patients knew their target serum urate (SU) goal, despite the central role of achieving and maintaining the SU goal with urate-lowering therapy (ULT)."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, government-funded low-income vision care programs in Canada improve utilization of eye care services among low-income individuals, particularly among those with financial difficulty."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes in premature infants, including higher mortality and stillbirth rates."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays a role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis (HD). Intradialytic changes in ET-1 levels were found to be associated with the development of hypotension and rebound hypertension during HD."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "No, frozen section analysis does not alter the intraoperative management of patients with multinodular thyroid disease."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones, particularly in the areas of financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The term \"globulomaxillary cyst\" is no longer considered a valid diagnostic entity, and the cystic lesions that were previously classified as such are now recognized as belonging to other entities."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to the study, pre-treatment fears and optimism can predict long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms do matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials, particularly in older adults with advanced cancer. Those with more symptoms tend to have poorer outcomes, including more admissions, complications, and greater decline in functional status."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy offers a significant improvement in quality of life and sleep parameters in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is found to reduce disability in the elderly. An increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit was linked to a 0.46 percentage point decrease in mobility limitations among single elderly individuals."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only one clinical identifier, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, was associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR) in early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concerns about the use of cold preparations in young children still exist, as 72% of caregivers incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vitamin C can prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, with the highest effectiveness observed at a dose of 1500 mg per day."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, plate clearing is a risk factor for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "No, clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not accurate enough, as only 39% of physicians were able to correctly identify ACS based on physical examination and clinical impression."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant difference in the quality of total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery between supervised colorectal trainees and consultants."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools, particularly in terms of the clarity and enforcement of the policy."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not solely a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality, as there is a significant correlation between eye tracking and speed discrimination in control subjects but not in patients."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation (SRF) in the left atrium."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "Yes, anastomotic leakage after rectal resection for cancer does affect functional outcome, specifically continence function, as there is no significant difference in continence score between patients with and without leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "No significant correlation was found between the presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences (waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC)) are associated with height in a non-linear manner, with a scaling exponent of approximately 0.76-0.80 for WC and 0.45-0.53 for HC in men and women, respectively, after adjusting for age and race."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pain is a clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high prevalence of pain complaints among psychiatric patients, particularly among those with affective disorders and those with a history of depression and past admissions to psychiatric hospitals."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients, with older adults showing lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant correlation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis, with 69.1% of patients having plaques and discopathy at the same site."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Routine laboratory parameters, including mean corpuscular volume (MCV), AST/ALT ratio, and sex, can be useful in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) in clinical practice."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "No, immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) does not significantly compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "No, the inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries. In fact, economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "No, the use of postoperative antibiotics does not appear to have a significant impact on reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity, including pain control, fever, secondary hemorrhage, or length of hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring through the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is both helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no advantage to using an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures compared to a sliding compression hip screw, based on the results of this study."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "Only 57% of rheumatoid arthritis patients in the study were physically able to participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care program due to limitations in sight, reach, and grip strength."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Yes, context matters for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The study found that there are spatial variations in the relationship between deprivation and mortality, with areas in the West of Scotland having higher mortality rates than the rest of the country, even after controlling for deprivation levels."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately 12% of the variability in the outcome of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a Veterans Affairs (VA) specialty clinic was due to differences between therapists. The trainer identified several characteristics and actions of effective therapists, including effectively addressing patient avoidance, using flexible interpersonal style, and developing a strong therapeutic alliance. These findings suggest that there is some degree of uniformity in the implementation of evidence-based treatments in practice, but that there is still room for improvement in terms of therapist variability and effectiveness."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location, with black and minority ethnic groups being up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. Additionally, there is an inverse relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some groups, with a decrease in depression diagnosis for groups with higher proportions of their own ethnicity in the neighbourhood."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic postural stability, and functional ambulation in patients with Parkinson's disease."}

Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prophylactic antibiotics may be necessary for totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD) placement by interventional radiologists, as the rate of early infection (CLABSI) was found to be 0.6% within 30 days of placement."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that the application of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel to the socket of mandibular third molars can enhance healing after surgical extraction, as evidenced by a lower postoperative pain score and better socket healing."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction, with physicians tending to underestimate the impact of symptoms on patients' quality of life."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, accompanying metabolic syndrome contributes to increased heart dimensions in hypertensive patients, specifically in terms of left atrial diameter."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) can be predicted at disease onset based on certain baseline factors. The study found that elevated plasma viscosity (PV) at baseline was associated with a reduced probability of stopping steroids within 5 years (HR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.82 for a PV>or = 2.00 mPa s compared with a PV<or = 1.80 mPa s; overall P = 0.024). Additionally, starting treatment at >15 mg prednisolone was also associated with"}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that surgical resection may not be necessary for patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who receive chemoradiotherapy, as the addition of surgery did not significantly improve overall survival or disease-free survival."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism is based on beta-endorphin deficiency. The study found that plasma levels of beta-endorphin were significantly lower in alcoholics during acute alcohol withdrawal compared to controls, and that this deficiency was associated with increased anxiety. The correlation between beta-endorphin levels and anxiety was independent of the effects of the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion. Additionally, the study found that the inverse relationship between beta-endorphin and craving was significant only on day 14 of withdrawal, suggesting that this deficiency may play a role"}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "No, increased use of private healthcare does not reduce the demand for NHS care. In fact, the study found that areas with higher private healthcare usage had higher NHS referral rates."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "There is no significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation, except in primiparous women, where the incidence of extreme skewing (90% or greater) is significantly higher."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improves the management of pain at the end of life, with hospice residents being twice as likely as non-hospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department was suboptimal, with only 57% of patients receiving complete in-hospital continuity of care. Emergent cases were associated with higher rates of preoperative assessment, but elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had lower rates of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate compared to same-day admission patients."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "No, oophorectomy is not necessary for all children with ovarian torsion, as many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone, as suggested by the adult gynecology literature."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is sufficient for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis, with similar image quality compared to full-dose imaging."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no evidence of an increase in reported unsafe sexual behavior among HIV-infected individuals over time."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that chemotherapy may be an independent predictor of survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, and that pneumologists' skepticism towards this treatment may be unwarranted."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "Yes, provider service networks (PSNs) in Florida's Medicaid program result in lower expenditures compared to HMOs, with a difference of $7 per month per enrollee."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The ADAM questionnaire is not a reliable tool for the screening of partial androgenic deficiency of aging men, with a low sensitivity and specificity. Item 1 of the questionnaire (decreased sexual desire) is a better predictor of hypogonadism than the complete questionnaire."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. The study found that a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) was associated with a low fetal blood pH (pH<7.20) in both term and preterm fetuses, with a predictive value of 67% in both groups. Additionally, the study found that both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, emergency ultrasound fellowship programs significantly impact emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education, with residents in programs with fellowships performing more scans and reporting more applications of bedside ultrasound compared to those in programs without fellowships."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, obesity has a significant impact on the pattern and outcome of trauma in children, with obese children more likely to have certain types of injuries, such as rib fractures and pelvic injuries, and a higher injury severity score and lower pediatric trauma score compared to non-obese children. However, there was no significant association between obesity and mortality in this study."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "No, these factors are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection. In fact, the study found that operative blood loss and time were greater in the group undergoing open surgery (group IV) compared to the laparoscopic groups (I, II, and III), and morbidity was highest in group IV. Additionally, length of hospital stay was longest in group IV."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the year of radical prostatectomy (RP) is a predictor of treatment outcome in prostate cancer, with better outcomes observed in patients undergoing surgery in the mid-1990s compared to earlier or later periods."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "Risk factors for major depression during midlife among women with and without prior major depression are different. Women without a prior MDD history had a lower risk of developing MDD during midlife compared to those with a prior MDD history, and their risk profiles differed. Health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms were risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD, while being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Yes, early extubation (within 24 hours) should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery, as it is associated with lower mortality and a lower rate of reintubation compared to delayed extubation."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, environmental factors are important in primary systemic vasculitis (PSV). The study found significant associations between PSV and several environmental factors, including farming in the index year and during working lifetime, high occupational silica and solvent exposure in the index year and during working lifetime, drug allergy, and overall allergy. These findings suggest that environmental exposures may play a role in the development of PSV."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "Yes, flexible instruments can create adequate femoral tunnel lengths at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The study found that the mean intra-osseous length for 90\u00b0 flexion was 32.1 mm, which was within the acceptable range for ACL reconstruction. Additionally, there were no significant differences in distance to the LCL among the groups, and a trend towards longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with increased flexion was observed."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the duration of radiotherapy (RT) treatment is a significant predictor of outcome in prostate cancer, with longer treatment times associated with lower freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rates."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement in patients with double prostheses may not be safe, as 4 out of 13 patients who underwent this procedure died within a week after surgery."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that acute hepatitis C in Israel is predominantly transmitted via iatrogenic means, with the majority of cases (65%) resulting from minimal procedures and clinical settings."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, our study suggests that breast-feeding may provide protection against childhood illness in children with a family history of atopy."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates, with an overall detection rate of 55% and a significant inverse association between prostate volume and cancer detection."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in morbidity, mortality, or hospitalization costs between patients who received regional anesthesia and those who received general anesthesia for surgery in geriatric patients with hip fracture."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, direct mesocolon invasion should be included in the T4 category for the staging of gastric cancer."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "No, mutations causing low HDL-C do not promote increased carotid intima-media thickness."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the EQ-5D is a valid quality of life instrument in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as it shows significant correlations with the MacNew heart-related quality of life scale and is significantly associated with the MacNew global score in multiple linear regression analysis."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care (cardiology) is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure, compared to general medicine care alone."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that there is an intrauterine influence on obesity, with maternal obesity being associated with increased obesity among offspring."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used to assess left ventricular function in brain-dead donors and may identify hearts that are marginally acceptable for transplantation, with an ejection fraction above 40%. However, the study found that the FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients, suggesting that the assessment may not be entirely accurate."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a common and potentially lethal practice among children, preteens, and adolescents, characterized by the use of hanging or other means to induce hypoxia/anoxia for sexual excitement. While it may seem like a secret pleasure, AEA can lead to unintended death and is a significant concern for pediatricians. The study highlights the importance of pediatricians' knowledge and awareness of this syndrome, as well as their willingness to discuss concerns and provide appropriate intervention."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "No, STIR imaging cannot be omitted for the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T. T1-weighted (T1w) sequences revealed a higher sensitivity and better lesion conspicuity, delineation, and image quality compared to STIR imaging, with a significant difference in the detection of bone metastases between the two sequences at both field strengths."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "No, the approved doctors and medical referees in the UK do not agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness, with a poor overall agreement (Kappa K = 0.18) between the two groups."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy is associated with kidney damage in women with more parities."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the antibacterial-loaded hydrogel was able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro and showed bactericidal and antibiofilm effects in combination with various antibacterials. Approximately 80% of the hydrogel coating was retrieved on the implant after press-fit insertion."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity does affect where people with cancer die. The study found that individuals from certain ethnic groups were more likely to die in hospitals, while others were more likely to die at home. Specifically, those born in Asia and Africa were more likely to die in hospitals, while those born in the Caribbean were less likely to die at home."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a significant proportion of women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have Lynch syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer), with 5 out of 59 patients (8.5%) found to have a germline mutation in MSH2, MSH6, or MLH1."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "Yes, low birth weight is a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, as detected by the presence of CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, better ambulatory process of care is associated with better health-related quality of life outcomes for patients with chronic disease."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the currently available prediction equations for basal metabolic rate (BMR) in Chinese adults are not entirely applicable, and a new equation was developed and validated in a large BMI range. The new equation, which includes gender, weight, and BMI, showed an accuracy rate of 78% in predicting BMR within 10% of the actual value. The equation performed well in both the development and validation groups, with an accuracy rate of 80% in the cross-validation test. Therefore, the study suggests that the new equation is a useful tool for estimating BMR in Chinese adults, particularly for those with a BMI greater than 23."}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, physician-examiners can participate in the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) remotely, with a correlation in scores between local and remote examiners found in several stations."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes, independent of other known prognostic factors."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "No, the position of the patient during liver surgery does not seem to influence the risk of venous air embolism, as there was no pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions tested."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that exposure to arsenic among Swedish art glass workers may be associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, particularly in combination with cardiovascular disease."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the current readiness guidelines based on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs are not effective in predicting the surge capacity and injury severity distribution in Israeli hospitals during terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD), with a significantly lower proportion of patients with PUD receiving eradication therapy compared to non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD)."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read to some extent, as the study found that about 60% of participants developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range, despite the fact that the left hemisphere was removed in these individuals. Additionally, phonological awareness and verbal memory, which are components of phonological processing, were found to be spared in the majority of participants, and were positively correlated with reading levels."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination. Eliminating \"missed opportunities\" for vaccination in these settings could cut racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination by roughly half."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, non-invasive diagnosis of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis is possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography. The study found that the splenic index (SPI) is the most accurate parameter for predicting the presence of esophageal varices, with a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0 offering the highest diagnostic accuracy."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is less invasive than retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) based on the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) and lactate in the blood samples collected during and after surgery. The study found that RALP resulted in lower levels of IL-6 and CRP at various time points after surgery, indicating a less invasive surgical trauma. Additionally, lactate levels were higher in the RRP group at certain time points, suggesting a greater metabolic stress."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Yes, the frequency of skin care has a significant effect on the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients, with a lower incidence and severity observed in the group that received skin care every 6 hours compared to every 12 hours."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that insulin resistance drives the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk. Adjusting for insulin sensitivity eliminated the association between fasting glucose and cardiovascular risk, and the association between 2-hour glucose and cardiovascular risk disappeared when adjusting for both insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose. Insulin sensitivity, on the other hand, remained associated with cardiovascular risk after adjusting for glucose levels."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Yes, preoperative tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) can be clinically useful in newborns with esophageal atresia (EA), particularly in modifying the surgical approach and detecting unsuspected fistulas or malformations of the respiratory tree. In this study, TBS was found to be useful in 45.2% of the patients, including 24.2% of the infants."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The validation of the 2009 TNM version for primary tumor classification in kidney cancer in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma suggests that further improvements are needed. The study found that the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of cancer-specific survival (CSS) in multivariable analysis, but the subclassification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system does not significantly predict mortality, transfusion requirements, or non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. However, dividing fractures into stable and unstable types allows for better prediction of mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, parity (number of previous pregnancies) is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy, as measured by the peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and increased risk of gestational diabetes (GDM)."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cognitive function predicts frequency-compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is evidence to suggest that polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes, specifically the beta1Gly49 homozygotes, are associated with an increased risk of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "No, participation in a preoperative medically supervised weight loss program (MSWM) did not improve bariatric surgery outcomes in this study of publicly insured patients."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that balloon predilatation may not be necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) as there were no significant differences in early hemodynamic results or complication rates between the groups."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of rt-PA between men and women in acute stroke patients."}

The study found that EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients, with a high correlation between the mutations detected in serum and tumor samples (87.7%)."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "The use of Web-based systems in medical oncology is not universally adopted in the Australian setting due to a range of factors, including clinician-specific and environmental issues. While the Web-based system plays a major role in guiding oncology treatment, its use varies according to hospital location, clinician roles, and experience. Therefore, it is not a straightforward answer to the question of whether Web-based systems are the answer to standardizing care in medical oncology."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Yes, being small for gestational age (SGA) is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The study found that SGA infants had a higher prevalence of ROP compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fast food consumption is associated with an increased risk of wheeze and current wheeze in children, and marginally significantly related to exercise-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR)."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "Yes, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass is an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia in cases where there is insufficient venous material for a straightforward femorocrural reconstruction. The study found that the cumulative primary patency rate was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years, and the limb salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and 3 years."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method (SLBM) can measure mesopic pupil size with reasonable accuracy. The study found that the mean difference between SLBM and Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP) was -0.60 mm and -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings, and they were very similar using the first reading. The intraobserver reproducibility of SLBM was good, with a width of the 95% limit of agreement (LoA) ranging from 1.79 to 2.30 mm, and the intraclass"}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI in subjects with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The study found that different FTLD-TDP types (1-3) were associated with distinct patterns of atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes."}

{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The study found that discharge documentation did not correctly identify falls risk for most patients, and there was limited assessment of falls risk factors and implementation of fall prevention strategies. Therefore, it can be concluded that the guidelines for preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation were not fully met."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study found that there is a significant variation in follow-up rates of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) according to patient factors and year of device implantation, with white patients more likely to have an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks compared to black patients and patients of other races. Additionally, there was an improvement in follow-up rates over time, with a significant increase in the rate of follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks and 0 to 16 weeks, but the rate of follow-up within 1 year remained high at 78.0%. However, the study suggests that experts' recommendations for"}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "There are significant differences in the ability of different CT scanner models to accurately identify urinary stone compositions based on CT attenuation values, with some models providing more consistent results than others."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are differences in the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK). The study found that ASA resulted in stronger and more rigid corneas, particularly in the anterior and peripheral regions, compared to SBK. This suggests that ASA may be biomechanically safer than SBK in reducing the risk of keratectasia after surgery. However, both techniques still have some disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing in the adult human cor"}

{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the tissues of the anal canal suggests that hormonal influences may play a role in anal continence in women, with a higher prevalence of receptors in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue. However, the study did not find any specific staining for ER or PR in the nuclei of striated muscle cells of the external sphincter in either males or females, which may indicate a lesser role for hormonal influences in anal continence in this region."}

The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The long-term outcomes of the transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) and transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for Hirschsprung disease (HD) are similar, with no significant difference in overall scores. However, there is a trend towards better continence in the ABD group and better stool pattern score in the TERPT group."}
