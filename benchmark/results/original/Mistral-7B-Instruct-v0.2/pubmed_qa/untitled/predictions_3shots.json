{"answers": "These data suggest that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol after radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer is not associated with a good prognosis. In fact, the median overall and recurrence-free survival, as well as the rate of tumor progression and cancer-related death, were worse in the protocol group compared to the matched and remaining groups."}
{"answers": "An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available.", "prediction_text": "Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis can lead to the detection of incidental findings, but the benefits are outweighed by the increased radiation exposure and cost in the majority of cases. The findings are often incidental and can be confirmed with non-invasive follow-up imaging. The study identified only one case of a significant finding that was only visible on the delayed phase images. Overall, the use of delayed imaging resulted in a significant increase in radiation dose."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.", "prediction_text": "The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale is not related to objective measures of attention and verbal memory but is significantly related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems. Therefore, it does not directly identify cognitive impairments."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that NA treatment can be stopped in selected patients with CHB as long as they are not cirrhotic, have completed a minimum period of treatment, have normal ALT and sustained undetectable DNA. These patients should be closely monitored during the first year and then indefinitely.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that discontinuing nucleos(t)ide analog therapy in selected patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B may result in virological relapse, with the majority of relapses occurring within the first year after discontinuation. The decision to stop treatment should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as treatment duration, age, and individual patient characteristics."}
{"answers": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures.", "prediction_text": "The diameter of the aneurysm is a more significant predictor of aortic aneurysm rupture than atmospheric pressure. The study did not find a statistically significant relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm rupture, but a trend towards higher rupture of larger aneurysms (>7 cm) in patients with an increase in pressure was observed, particularly in those with hypertension."}
{"answers": "Findings from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate measure for hot flashes.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of the study, the sternal skin conductance device has limited accuracy in measuring hot flashes and its acceptability by women is questionable due to interference with daily activities. Further research is needed to improve the device's functionality and accuracy."}
{"answers": ": Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.", "prediction_text": "Prophylactic fixation can be a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral fragility hip fracture in certain subgroups of patients, specifically women aged 71 to 75 years old with a 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture, and women younger than age 70 years. However, the cost-effectiveness of the procedure is highly dependent on the additional costs of the intervention and its effectiveness."}
{"answers": "We found that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense of which criteria may be \"high yield\" in ranking applicants by analyzing data from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of orthopaedic residents.", "prediction_text": "Preresidency selection factors, such as USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, and number of publications, have a moderate to weak correlation with objective measures of resident performance, such as American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores. Additionally, AOA membership is associated with higher subjective ratings by faculty, particularly in the areas of interpersonal and communication skills."}
{"answers": "In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal markers.", "prediction_text": "Antral follicle assessment can provide additional predictive value in addition to age and basal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels for in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. The study suggests that a higher number of antral follicles (>6) is associated with a higher clinical pregnancy rate and lower cancellation rate. However, it is important to note that this is a preliminary study and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion affect survival.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in survival between nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment who received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding tube and those who did not. Additionally, the timing of feeding tube insertion did not impact survival."}
{"answers": "In this well established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic screening is not compromised by early discharge.", "prediction_text": "Early discharge with nurse home visits results in a higher rate of inadequate initial filter paper specimens but also a higher rate of repeat specimens and a higher likelihood of having an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life compared to traditional hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The palliative treatment concept of 25\u00a0Gy applied in 5\u00a0fractions is sufficient for radiation of lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients treated with the higher total dose regimen.", "prediction_text": "The present analysis did not find a statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients receiving 25 Gy in 5 fractions or 50 Gy in 20 fractions for palliative treatment of lung cancer. However, a subgroup analysis suggested that patients with a good-fair overall condition may have a slightly longer survival with the higher dose regimen. The benefit of high-dose radiotherapy in palliative lung cancer patients remains uncertain."}
{"answers": "Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that while leukocyte count and CRP measurements can be useful in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, there are still a significant number of patients with acute appendicitis who do not present with elevated levels of these markers. Therefore, these tests should not be relied upon exclusively for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly population."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without fear of major cardiac depressant effect.", "prediction_text": "Desflurane does not significantly alter left ventricular function when used to control surgically-induced hypertension during aortic surgery. However, it does increase afterload as indicated by an increase in systemic vascular resistance index, end-systolic wall-stress, and left-ventricular stroke work index."}
{"answers": "Development of tolerance to gluten seems possible in some patients with CD. Further follow-up will show whether this tolerance is permanent or only a long-term return to latency. This feature may be associated with genetic characteristics, especially with HLA genotypes that differ from DQ2 or DQ8. More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Rare cases of gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease have been reported, but more research is needed to determine the exact prevalence and potential risk factors."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "The WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers do not meet the nutritional requirements for vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, selenium, zinc, and pantothenic acid, and essential fatty acids in the South African context. Home-prepared replacement milks using powdered full cream milk or fresh full cream milk with micronutrient supplements are less expensive but require longer preparation times and do not provide adequate amounts of some micronutrients and essential fatty acids compared to commercial formula."}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that inhaled corticosteroids can influence the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients by modifying the effect of airway inflammation. However, the relationship is complex and influenced by factors such as baseline airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophilic inflammation. The findings indicate that inhaled corticosteroids can improve the perception of dyspnea in asthma patients with obstruction, while in those without obstruction, eosinophil counts may be positively associated with dyspnea perception."}
{"answers": "High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more proactive invitational procedures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that older people with higher financial assets were less likely to accept preventive home visits if they were not invited using a letter with a proposed date, but the association between socioeconomic status and acceptance rates was attenuated when adjusting for invitational procedures."}
{"answers": "In the present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.", "prediction_text": "In women, the correlation between circulating androgens and sexual desire is inconclusive, but androgen substitution can improve sexual function in those with androgen deficiency. The study suggests that free testosterone and androstenedione may be better correlated with sexual desire than androsterone glucuronide."}
{"answers": "The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.", "prediction_text": "The presence of both major depression and alcohol use disorder during adolescence is associated with poorer subsequent depression outcomes, but this association may be explained by confounding factors such as gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse."}
{"answers": "There are no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions of the CTV.", "prediction_text": "No statistically significant differences in interfractional motion were found between the superior and inferior portions of the prostate bed clinical target volume."}
{"answers": "Combined end points for adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid endarterectomy.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, octogenarians do not necessarily represent a high-risk group for carotid endarterectomy, as the perioperative morbidity and mortality were low in this population."}
{"answers": "Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of GVHD.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the combination of lysosomotropic amines, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and cyclosporine can result in synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses to both minor and major histocompatibility antigens. This synergy may be due to the unique mechanism of action of lysosomotropic amines, which can suppress MHC class II antigen presentation differently from current immune suppressant drugs like cyclosporine."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", "prediction_text": "Exercise training leads to a lower heart rate and increased heart rate variability in both genders. Trained women exhibit a shorter QT interval and a reduced QT/RR slope compared to sedentary women, while no significant difference in QT interval is observed between trained and sedentary men."}
{"answers": "Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant correlation between base deficit and mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury."}
{"answers": "\"Aquagenic maladies\" could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.", "prediction_text": "The presented case series suggests that syncope during bathing in infants may be a form of water-induced urticaria, also known as aquagenic urticaria. The condition is characterized by the development of hives or skin reactions upon contact with water. The infants in this study had a positive family history of dermographism and an increase in histamine levels after a trial bath. The condition improved in some cases but persisted in others. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and establish the best management approach."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant changes in peri-sinusoidal cell function, as indicated by beta-NAH levels, following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, post-operative elevations in AST and ALT levels were observed in the study group."}
{"answers": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adjusting for reporting heterogeneity can provide more accurate results in the analysis of sleep disorders, as it accounts for individual differences in response category cut-points and can lead to a better understanding of the factors associated with sleep disorders."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that men had a higher conversion rate, longer operative time, and a greater incidence of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforations, and severe inflammation compared to women undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Men were also more likely to experience biliary injuries as an independent risk factor."}
{"answers": "To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.", "prediction_text": "The study demonstrates that fluoroscopy is not essential for the successful retrieval of lower ureteric stones through ureteroscopy in the majority of cases. However, its use may still be required in specific situations such as complex anatomy or difficult stone removal."}
{"answers": "Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.", "prediction_text": "The length of stay in the intensive care unit and non-ICU stay longer than 10 days, but not injury severity scores, were found to be significant predictors of heterotopic ossification following open reduction internal fixation of acetabular fractures treated with a posterior approach."}
{"answers": "In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the use of epidural analgesia during and after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) does not appear to significantly increase the risks of haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis, or epidural abscess. However, caution should be exercised in patients with thrombopenia or coagulation disorders before catheter removal."}
{"answers": "The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.", "prediction_text": "The use of a smartphone with an insulin dose advisor can contribute to improved glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes patients, but the addition of telemonitoring and teleconsultation functions may enhance the effect."}
{"answers": "Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.", "prediction_text": "The attendance rate and recall rate were higher in the non-Sami population, but the rate of invasive cancer detected through mammographic screening was not significantly different between the Sami and non-Sami groups. However, a lower percentage of all breast cancers were detected through the screening program in the Sami population."}
{"answers": "GP ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the percentage of patients maintaining sinus rhythm off-antiarrhythmic drugs between those undergoing Cox-Maze IV procedure with and without ganglionated plexi ablation. The study identified other factors, such as duration of atrial fibrillation, left atrial diameter, left atrial area, absence of connecting lesions, and absence of right atrial ablation, as independent predictors of AF recurrence."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, serum pancreatic lipase has a higher diagnostic accuracy for acute pancreatitis compared to serum amylase. However, it is important to note that both markers have their roles in the diagnosis of pancreatitis and the decision to use one over the other should be based on clinical context and availability. The study suggests that a clinically useful cut-off point for serum pancreatic lipase is 208 U/L and for serum amylase is 114 U/L. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of using serum pancreatic lip"}
{"answers": "Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates the technical feasibility of performing transgastric endoscopic splenectomy using a flexible endoscope in a porcine model."}
{"answers": "Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.", "prediction_text": "The presence of a significant side-to-side difference in systolic blood pressure can be used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome, and the severity of the steal may be predicted by the type of vertebral artery waveform, with complete reversal and alternating flow being associated with greater blood pressure differences."}
{"answers": "a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.", "prediction_text": "Transcranial direct current stimulation can potentially help differentiate unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients by revealing residual networks and improving cortical connectivity and excitability."}
{"answers": "Most people in France are influenced by situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.", "prediction_text": "Lay people and psychologists generally find it more acceptable than physicians to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease. The patient's intentions to protect his wife and inform her of the disease have the greatest impact on acceptability. However, there is variability among lay people, with some finding it always acceptable and others never acceptable."}
{"answers": "Most students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be taught in a nonclinical setting.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that while most medical students encounter a significant number of the recommended core conditions during their EM clerkship, not all students will encounter all 10 conditions. The average number of conditions seen per student is close to the recommended 10, but there is variability in the percentage of students who see each condition."}
{"answers": "The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.", "prediction_text": "Bile duct sludge and bile duct stones have similar recurrence rates after endoscopic therapy, but bile duct sludge is less likely to be associated with common bile duct dilation and other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones. However, the clinical significance of bile duct sludge remains unclear and further research is needed to fully understand its implications."}
{"answers": "Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the placement of a nasogastric tube during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy may reduce the risk of staple line leaks, but it is associated with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "The results obtained in this study demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) is a valuable tool for staging colorectal cancer during laparoscopic surgery, particularly in the detection of hepatic metastases and nodal metastases, although it has a lower specificity compared to laparoscopy. It can lead to changes in therapeutic approach in a significant number of cases."}
{"answers": "Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.", "prediction_text": "According to the findings of this study, IBS experts are less likely to consider IBS a diagnosis of exclusion and are more likely to make a positive diagnosis based on the Rome criteria alone, with fewer tests and lower costs compared to nonexperts."}
{"answers": "Correlation between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or ombilical incision is mandatory.", "prediction_text": "The correlation between the radiographic transition zone and the level of aganglionosis on the specimen in Hirschsprung's disease is inaccurate, with a moderate agreement (\u03ba = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57])."}
{"answers": "The presence of a high signal intensity change on T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors for patients with CSA.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of spinal cord involvement as indicated by T2 high signal intensity areas on MRI and the presence of a pyramidal tract sign are associated with a poorer neurological prognosis in patients with cervical spondylotic amyotrophy."}
{"answers": "We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool.", "prediction_text": "The progression of low-tone sudden deafness to Meniere's disease is not inevitable, as not all patients with low-tone SD develop vertigo or Meniere's disease. However, those with recurrent episodes may be at a higher risk. The average -SP/AP (summating potential/action potential) of patients with a single episode is smaller than those with recurrent episodes or Meniere's disease."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the D allele of the ACE-1 gene may be associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Older people with a history of amblyopia who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the improvement appears to be sustained.", "prediction_text": "No, visual loss due to amblyopia can improve, particularly in cases where there is a history of amblyopia and an improvement of one or more lines of visual acuity is recorded."}
{"answers": "These results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.", "prediction_text": "The present study demonstrates a strong correlation of results between two laboratories using different methodologies for BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR, indicating that correlated results are possible even with different homebrew assays. However, discrepancies may occur due to technical limitations, such as minimal RNA yield."}
{"answers": "Although the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.", "prediction_text": "Yes, this case report describes a rare occurrence of a spinal subdural hematoma following a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. The exact mechanism of this association is not well understood and requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.", "prediction_text": "The present study reports slight changes in QRS electric axis, heart rate, and QT interval on ECG, as well as an increase in left atrial and aortic root diameter on echocardiography following LAA occlusion therapy. However, no significant differences were observed in echocardiographic parameters before and after device implantation."}
{"answers": "The study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is radiographically demonstrated.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that untethering prior to scoliosis correction may not be necessary for all patients with myelomeningocele, as no new neurological complications were observed in the patients who did not undergo untethering before surgery. However, individual cases should be evaluated carefully and the decision to proceed without untethering should be made on a case-by-case basis."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, pulp chamber pulpotomy with ProRoot MTA(\u00ae) can be considered as a successful intermediate-term treatment option for vital pulp therapy. However, it may require additional root canal treatment in some cases."}
{"answers": "The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.", "prediction_text": "The site of endovenous access during endovenous laser ablation for small saphenous varicose veins does not significantly influence early outcomes in terms of complications and recurrence."}
{"answers": "Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.", "prediction_text": "The finding of a retinal hemorrhage after a convulsive episode in a child should prompt further investigation to rule out underlying systemic disorders or child abuse. However, the likelihood of this finding being related to child abuse is low in the absence of other risk factors."}
{"answers": "Clear and distinct differences between the two studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.", "prediction_text": "The Global Longitudinal Pathway medical education curriculum has a positive influence on medical students' skills and attitudes toward working with culturally diverse populations, as evidenced by both statistical and qualitative analysis."}
{"answers": "In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, it appears that only a very small percentage (1.3%) of colorectal cancers may be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopies."}
{"answers": "Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention, with interactions occurring at early processing stages and additive effects at later stages."}
{"answers": "Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pancreas retransplantation can provide a second chance for type 1 diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease, as it can lead to improved pancreas function and patient survival, with no negative impact on kidney graft function and survival."}
{"answers": "Weekend hospitalization leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that Medicare patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction on weekends are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures and experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including increased mortality and readmission, compared to weekday patients. This indicates that weekend care may not be of the same quality as weekday care. However, it's important to note that this study focuses on Medicare patients and the findings may not be generalizable to other populations or healthcare systems."}
{"answers": "The presence of more than one virus in hospitalized children with ARI is very frequent but it does not seem to have a major clinical impact in terms of severity. However bacterial superinfection increases the severity of the disease course. On the contrary, pneumococcal vaccination plays a protective role.", "prediction_text": "The presence of bacterial superinfection, rather than viral co-infection, is associated with increased severity, longer hospital stays, and higher risk of PICU admission in children with acute respiratory infections. Pneumococcal vaccination is a protective factor against severity and respiratory support requirement."}
{"answers": "In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between the time from emergency room registration to appendectomy (ETA) and the incidence of perforation or postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. However, patients with longer ETA did have a longer hospital stay. Other factors, such as age, neutrophil count, and open appendectomy, were found to be significant predictors of postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "Fetal gender does not affect the risk of having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "No, fetal gender is not associated with an increased risk of having an emergency department visit for asthma during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that working exposure increases the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a higher prevalence of rotator cuff tears in certain occupations, such as agriculture and forestry, and the building industry."}
{"answers": "High-quality training, strict compliance with evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a zero central line-associated bloodstream infection rate can be sustained with ongoing training, surveillance, vigilance, and adherence to evidence-based practices."}
{"answers": "Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.", "prediction_text": "Atropine as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures does not significantly reduce hypersalivation, but may increase the risk of transient rash and vomiting during recovery. The decision to use atropine should be based on the individual patient's clinical needs and the potential for these side effects."}
{"answers": "Findings depict wandering and PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of wandering and agitation.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, wandering and physically nonaggressive agitation are not equivalent concepts, as they load on different factors in the factor analysis. However, there is a significant correlation between the two."}
{"answers": "An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of an advance care planning model in community palliative care is feasible, with a focus on embedding conversations and family involvement rather than just document completion. Adaptation to local contexts and changes to quality audit processes are essential for successful integration."}
{"answers": "The study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.", "prediction_text": "Yes, foreign bodies, particularly those located in the mucosal areas of the gastrointestinal tract, can migrate and potentially move towards the heart, although this is a rare occurrence. The mechanisms of migration include local inflammation, peristalsis, and erosion of surrounding tissues. Diagnosis can be challenging and may require a combination of clinical evaluation, radiologic imaging, endoscopy, and ultrasound."}
{"answers": "Although most players in the study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that rugby headgear can prevent concussion.", "prediction_text": "The belief that rugby headgear can prevent concussion is not universally held among players or coaches, and its use is not widespread despite this belief. The reasons for not using headgear include it not being mandatory, discomfort, and cost. The preventive effect of headgear against concussion is not conclusively proven."}
{"answers": "Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique to laparoscopy.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that early postoperative feeding after laparotomy and colorectal resection is possible, but it may be associated with a higher rate of vomiting compared to traditional feeding methods. The length of hospital stay may be shorter in patients who do not require nasogastric tube reinsertion. Therefore, early postoperative oral intake is not limited to laparoscopic surgery."}
{"answers": "Both medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the control group. Medial or lateral PTS \u22655\u00b0 was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the present study suggests that steep posterior tibial slopes, both medial and lateral, are associated with an increased risk of failure of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction."}
{"answers": "These results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate subsequent clinical actions.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 37% of elderly patients correctly endorsed their intention to call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of correct endorsement include higher levels of education."}
{"answers": "We conclude that routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy may not be necessary in all cases, as most pneumothoraces are symptomatic and can be detected clinically. However, asymptomatic patients with significant pneumothoraces may still benefit from early detection with chest radiography."}
{"answers": "Early surfactant administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Early surfactant administration within one hour of birth does not significantly reduce the rates of chronic lung disease or mortality in premature infants compared to late surfactant administration. However, early surfactant treatment is associated with longer durations of ventilation, CPAP, and hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sickness absence.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that individuals who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood had an increased risk of long-term sick leave, specifically for neck pain, high back pain, low back pain, and any illness. They also had an increased risk of sick leave exceeding 8 weeks."}
{"answers": "We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that 0.9 mm-thick double-oblique CT images provide the best mandibular depiction, but there is no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images."}
{"answers": "Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative chemoradiation can reduce local recurrence and improve resection of mid and low rectal tumors, but it is not a definitive substitute for surgery. The decision to proceed with surgery should be based on the response to chemoradiation and the presence of risk factors such as lymph node metastases and perineural invasion. The risk of local recurrence remains significant, particularly in those who do not respond to chemoradiation or have high-risk features."}
{"answers": "Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the inclusion of multiple SNP testing in risk prediction models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers can improve predictive ability when used in conjunction with clinical assessment. However, the improvement is modest, with an average 1 - c-index value of 0.221 for BRCA1 and 0.215 for BRCA2 carriers."}
{"answers": "Bedtime NPH insulin added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.", "prediction_text": "In this study, adding insulin to ongoing oral hypoglycemic agents resulted in better glycemic control with fewer hypoglycemic events and less weight gain compared to insulin monotherapy in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. However, there was a higher rate of treatment failures in the insulin-in-addition group. The choice between the two options should be individualized based on patient preferences, tolerability, and clinical response."}
{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this PET study, amoxapine can be considered an atypical antipsychotic with high 5-HT2 occupancy and greater 5-HT2 than D2 occupancy."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "The continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine does not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes. However, a bolus injection of epinephrine can significantly decrease uterine blood flow."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that enhanced neutrophil migratory activity in response to interleukin-8 in the early post-trauma phase may contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT can improve the diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease by revealing significant reductions in regional cerebral blood flow in the left parietal cortex during memory tasks."}
{"answers": "1. DBE is a safe and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.", "prediction_text": "Double-balloon enteroscopy is an effective method for diagnosing small-bowel disorders, achieving a diagnostic yield of 75% and therapeutic yield of 63.6%. The procedure is generally safe, with minor complications occurring in only 9.1% of cases."}
{"answers": "Reorganization of care to offer a primary angioplasty service was acceptable to patients and their carers. Satisfaction levels were high regardless of the type of care received, with the exception of discharge and aftercare.", "prediction_text": "Based on the study, primary angioplasty is associated with higher patient satisfaction for some aspects of care, such as speed of treatment, but lower convenience for carers due to increased visiting requirements. Overall, patient and carer satisfaction with both primary angioplasty and thrombolysis is high, but satisfaction with discharge and aftercare is lower for both groups. The decision between the two treatments should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of individual patient needs and clinical circumstances."}
{"answers": "The leukocyte count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the leukocyte count at presentation is correlated with the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients, as indicated by a positive correlation with ISS and a negative correlation with GCS and RTS."}
{"answers": "Right ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that surgical timing may be a significant factor in the outcome of pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of Fallot, with better outcomes observed in those with preserved right ventricular function prior to surgery."}
{"answers": "Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.", "prediction_text": "The data from this study suggests that early second-look tympanoplasty can help identify and remove cholesteatoma before it becomes more extensive, potentially reducing the need for conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. However, the study does not provide definitive evidence that early second-look procedures alone can eliminate the need for such conversions entirely."}
{"answers": "In 1995, the first year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from facilities' compliance with federal regulations.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the implementation of the Mammography Quality Standards Act led to significant improvements in mammography quality in North Carolina, as evidenced by increased passing rates for phantom scores, darkroom fog, and temperature difference."}
{"answers": "HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the adoption of health information exchange is associated with a significant reduction in repeat imaging in emergency departments, as shown in the study for computed tomography, ultrasound, and chest x-ray. The reductions ranged from 44% to 67% relative to sample means."}
{"answers": "Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that gestational age misclassification alone does not fully explain the difference in birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites, as even extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights. Other factors, such as socioeconomic or environmental conditions, may also contribute to the observed difference."}
{"answers": "W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may not be truly clinically early cancer, as there is evidence of microscopic cancer cell infiltration into the portal tracts and the presence of minute cancerous foci at the time of surgery. However, there were no significant differences in disease-free survival between well-differentiated and less-differentiated HCCs. The absence of fibrous capsule formation in well-differentiated HCCs was the only significant difference observed."}
{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "Yes, post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages are more likely to occur at night (between 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.) than during the day. (71.2% of cases in this study occurred at night)."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that black patients were more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by their physicians compared to white patients, and this underestimation was associated with poorer quality asthma care and communication."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is a significant number of laboratories reporting incorrect results for hCG, with errors in reporting intact hCG as total beta hCG and vice versa."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons did not significantly change their practice regarding the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not provide conclusive evidence for apoptotic cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis. The presence of increased Bax expression and caspase activity does not necessarily indicate apoptosis, as other forms of programmed cell death or non-programmed cell death may also be involved. Further research is needed to clarify the nature of neuronal death in mesial temporal sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection. Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that Golytely may be associated with a higher adenoma detection rate compared to MiraLAX, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.091). However, Golytely was more likely to result in a better bowel preparation quality (BBPS score \u2265 7) and was 2.28 times more likely to be associated with adenoma detection on multivariate analysis."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "The growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not reliably predict a neoplastic polyp, but older age and a larger size are significant risk factors for neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "The identified KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, may represent a link between genetic and environmental factors in the development of atrial fibrillation, as it shows increased sensitivity to atrial stretch."}
{"answers": "The real-time PCR approach revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.", "prediction_text": "The use of real-time PCR as a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection and quantification of allergenic pollen taxa represents a promising perspective for aerobiological monitoring."}
{"answers": "The Ambu SIB was able to accurately deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which may pose risk during infant resuscitation.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the Ambu self-inflating bag provides adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight, while the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator had difficulty reaching set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end expiratory pressures in the infant model."}
{"answers": "This longitudinal study found no significant effect of menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between menopausal transition and overall quality of life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36. However, vasomotor symptoms were found to negatively impact role limitation due to emotional problems."}
{"answers": "The incidence of CPM is not increased in IVF/ICSI pregnancies compared with spontaneous conceptions. CPM probably does not account for the adverse perinatal outcomes following IVF/ICSI.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in the incidence of confined placental mosaicism between IVF/ICSI pregnancies and spontaneous conceptions. Therefore, it is unclear if confined placental mosaicism is a significant contributor to adverse perinatal outcomes in IVF pregnancies."}
{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "The APACHE II score, while useful as an admission tool, may not accurately reflect the physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients over the course of their ICU stay due to the influence of treatment effects."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "The evidence from the available studies is inconclusive regarding the association between appendiceal perforation and an increased risk of tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy due to methodological limitations and inconsistent findings."}
{"answers": "Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the density and structural properties of trabecular bone, as well as the presence of cortical bone, significantly influence the primary stability of miniscrews."}
{"answers": "Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.", "prediction_text": "The study found that approximately one-third of newly confirmed TB patients in western China were non-adherent to their prescribed treatment regimen. Factors associated with non-adherence include lack of direct observation and high monthly service expenses, while home visits and phone calls were protective factors."}
{"answers": "While not providing conclusive evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional control.", "prediction_text": "Induction chemotherapy improves survival and local control in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly those with T4 disease and undifferentiated subtypes. However, it is associated with a higher risk of distant failure. The decision to use induction chemotherapy should be individualized based on the patient's stage and subtype of nasopharyngeal carcinoma."}
{"answers": "There was increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta1. The study also found a significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and VEGF and TGF-\u03b21."}
{"answers": "Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This \"cr\u00eape-paper\" sign may alert endoscopists to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.", "prediction_text": "The presence of fragile, inelastic, and delicate esophageal mucosa, also referred to as \"cr\u00eape-paper\" mucosa, may be a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis."}
{"answers": "Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 (\u00d710(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting survival in ESCC patients.", "prediction_text": "A preoperative platelet count \u2264 205 (\u00d7 10(9)/L) is an independent prognostic factor for poorer survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in those with positive lymph node involvement."}
{"answers": "From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while an intraabdominal location increases the risk of testicular atrophy after orchiopexy, age at the time of surgery does not have a significant impact on testicular survival."}
{"answers": "The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.", "prediction_text": "Shorter durations of psychological treatment for depression are associated with a slightly increased risk of relapse and the need for additional treatment episodes."}
{"answers": "Written information sheets contribute to the process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what was discussed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a written information sheet can improve recall of the consent interview for total hip arthroplasty patients. The study showed that patients who received written information scored significantly higher on a recall questionnaire compared to those who received only verbal information."}
{"answers": "Although theoretically plausible, bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no significant difference in knee muscle strength and physical performance between bicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty at 6 and 12 months post-surgery."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that T-cell deficiency may protect against the impairment of spatial learning ability following toluene exposure, as indicated by a lack of significant difference in escape latency and probe trial results between nude mice and controls in the reversal phase. However, the acquisition phase showed a longer escape latency in nude mice exposed to high doses of toluene. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.", "prediction_text": "The presence of vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) is a specific but not sensitive finding for esophagitis in children, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis."}
{"answers": "At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no significant difference in average noise levels between high flow nasal cannulas and bubble CPAP for preterm infants. However, high flow nasal cannulas were quieter than bubble CPAP at low frequencies. Noise levels increased with increasing gas flows for both types of devices."}
{"answers": "Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth, specifically advanced cervical dilatation, is associated with an increased risk of recurrent preterm birth. This risk is higher than that of women with a history of preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. Additionally, women with a history of advanced cervical dilation tend to have shorter cervical lengths prior to 24 weeks compared to those with other clinical presentations."}
{"answers": "This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Paget's disease of bone is present in India, with common clinical manifestations including backache, headache, bone pains, and involvement of the skull and spine. The disease is more common in males and has a mean age of presentation in the fifth decade. The biochemical profile shows high alkaline phosphatase levels, which can be reduced with bisphosphonate treatment."}
{"answers": "The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and misty mesentery appearance on CT.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on multidetector computed tomography is approximately 7%. Obesity is a common factor among these patients, with 67.5% being classified as obese. However, further research is needed to establish a causal relationship between obesity and idiopathic misty mesentery."}
{"answers": "Percutaneous ethanol injection without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and the patient.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant difference in the success rates between percutaneous ethanol injection with and without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid for the treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules. However, aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid resulted in a longer procedure time and an increased risk of intracystic hemorrhage and the complaint of a double puncture."}
{"answers": "The present study, which is based on internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing disease activity.", "prediction_text": "In this study, increased disease activity and greater damage in SLE patients were associated with reduced physical function and role function due to emotional limitations, respectively. Age and disease duration did not show any significant correlation with health status."}
{"answers": "The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.", "prediction_text": "The clinical course and complications of intra-abdominal desmoid disease do not appear to differ significantly between patients with an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and those with an ileorectal anastomosis. However, the small sample size of this study should be taken into consideration."}
{"answers": "These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "prediction_text": "Schizophrenia patients with high pre-morbid intelligence may represent a clinically distinct subtype, as they display lower levels of negative and disorganized symptoms, better global functioning and insight, and higher levels of manic symptoms compared to typical schizophrenia patients."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that hearing loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in combination otic drops.", "prediction_text": "The use of betamethasone in aminoglycoside-containing ear drops does not provide a significant protective effect against cochlear toxicity."}
{"answers": "A fetal anatomic survey on follow-up sonograms may identify unanticipated fetal anomalies, especially when the indication is for fetal growth.", "prediction_text": "The findings of this study suggest that fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms can reveal unanticipated fetal anomalies, particularly in cases of fetal growth evaluation. These findings may lead to increased neonatal interventions."}
{"answers": "Patients with BRAF-mutant PTC had a significantly longer PFS than BRAF wild-type when treated with TKIs. However, due to the small number of BRAF-mutant patients, further investigations are required, especially to understand the potential positive effect of BRAF mutations in RAIR TC patients while having a negative prognostic impact in RAI-sensitive PTC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the identification of specific mutations, particularly BRAF, in radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers can provide valuable information for guiding therapy and predicting response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, the histologic subtype of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma also plays an important role in determining treatment outcome."}
{"answers": "The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.", "prediction_text": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can reduce the extent of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer, but the response to chemotherapy is an important factor in determining the topographical distribution of metastasis. The study suggests that deep stromal invasion and lymph vascular invasion are independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in the chemotherapy group. The number of lymph nodes involved, response to chemotherapy, tumor histology, and a positive vaginal margin are independent prognostic factors affecting disease-free survival or overall survival rates in node-positive patients treated with chemotherapy plus radical surgery."}
{"answers": "A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.", "prediction_text": "Prior benign prostate biopsy is associated with more favorable pathologic features and improved biochemical disease-free survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease, in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer."}
{"answers": "This clinical trial evaluated the possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that remote ischemic postconditioning may reduce myocardial lesions associated with percutaneous coronary intervention, but its protective effect might be less pronounced in diabetic patients. However, the study did not find a significant difference in the primary outcome variable (maximum increase in troponin in the first 24 hours) between the remote postischemic conditioning and placebo groups. The secondary outcome variable (readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up) also did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "These results indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats, as evidenced by a reduction in follicular degeneration and edema, decreased caspase-3 expression, and attenuation of oxidative stress markers."}
{"answers": "Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasonography has limited accuracy in the diagnosis of an undescended testis and should not be relied upon as the sole diagnostic tool. A clinical examination by a paediatric surgeon remains the gold standard."}
{"answers": "Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.", "prediction_text": "Mammographic density does not consistently correlate with the margin re-excision rate after breast-conserving surgery. However, the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ and the need for additional margin resection are significant predictors of re-excision."}
{"answers": "Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty is associated with a lower risk of minor oozing, bleeding, septal hematoma, and septal perforation when compared to nasal packing. However, the operating time is longer in the suturing group. The presence of postoperative adhesions and remnant deviated nasal septum is similar in both groups."}
{"answers": "The present study does not support the recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound can be considered as an adjunctive tool in the diagnostic evaluation of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint, but it has lower sensitivity compared to magnetic resonance imaging. The presence of articular sounds and physical signs alone are insufficient for accurate diagnosis. Further research and technical advancements may improve the diagnostic value of ultrasound."}
{"answers": "Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, and there is lack of correlation with tumour\u2011related factors including prognosis. Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 22).", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the use of serum leptin levels as a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer. However, a correlation between leptin levels and BMI was observed in lung cancer patients."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence of serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a quantitatively greater immune response.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not provide evidence for serovar-specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae in preventing reinfection."}
{"answers": "BPPV is associated with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.", "prediction_text": "The findings of this study suggest that certain viral infections, including HSV1, Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and CMV, may be associated with an increased risk of developing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The seasonal variation in viral activity may also play a role."}
{"answers": "We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, may be involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, with higher levels observed in patients with epilepsy or new onset seizures compared to healthy controls. However, the levels decrease during the seizure-free period. The correlations noted between specific demographic factors and cytokine levels suggest a potential role for these cytokines in the development and progression of epilepsy."}
{"answers": "Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.", "prediction_text": "Yes, somatostatin plays a role in mediating the insulinostatic effects of Neuromedin U in the rat pancreas by stimulating somatostatin secretion and inhibiting insulin secretion."}
{"answers": "Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.", "prediction_text": "The location and number of sutures used for hiatal hernia repair during laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding do not significantly impact length of stay, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, or postoperative BMI/%EWL. However, patients with fewer sutures had a shorter operating room time, and those with anterior suture placement had a shorter operating room time and shorter length of stay."}
{"answers": "Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.", "prediction_text": "The decision to anticoagulate a patient with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage and a clear indication for anticoagulation, such as nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, depends on the location of the previous hemorrhage. For patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy is preferred. However, for patients with prior deep hemispheric ICH, the decision is less clear and may depend on the individual patient's risk of thromboembolic stroke. The use of a decision-analysis model can help guide the clinical decision-making process."}
{"answers": "This study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be used to measure tumor hypoxia.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that while there is some overlap in the distribution of (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG in tumors, the correlation between the two tracers is not strong enough to support the use of (18)F-FDG as a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia."}
{"answers": "A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, mobility and social participation for people post stroke.", "prediction_text": "Treadmill training can lead to significant improvements in depression, mobility, and social participation for individuals in the chronic stage of recovery from stroke."}
{"answers": "Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.", "prediction_text": "Orthostatic myoclonus is an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness and gait impairment, particularly in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. It is a common finding, affecting approximately 17.2% of patients with unexplained unsteadiness or gait impairment. The diagnosis is based on the observation of non-rhythmic bursts during orthostatism, and it is often associated with other neurological disorders. Treatment with antimyoclonic agents may provide some improvement, but further research is needed to evaluate their long-term efficacy."}
{"answers": "Severely injured patients treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the level of trauma center providing treatment for severely injured trauma patients in this Australian health service is associated with a higher risk of mortality for those admitted to a level III trauma center compared to a level I trauma center. This difference is likely due to issues in care delivery at the level III center."}
{"answers": "Our data suggest that very few genes, which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "The present study identified six genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT and STC1) with a statistically uniform expression among women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. However, considerable differences were observed in the expression levels of the other genes analyzed. Therefore, it appears that there is no uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle."}
{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant challenges in coping with the anticipated increase in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-related adverse effects due to the \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization. The region's weak health systems, inadequate resources, and lack of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects hinder the ability to effectively prevent and manage these conditions."}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute chest wall rigidity caused by rapid intravenous fentanyl administration can contribute to rapid fatalities in illicit fentanyl abuse. The lack of detectable norfentanyl in some cases supports this hypothesis."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant improvement in live birth rates or a reduction in severe OHSS rates for women with polycystic morphology ovaries but no other features of PCOS, when treated with metformin during IVF."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.", "prediction_text": "EMS providers can provide tidal volumes within the recommended range when using a pediatric-sized BVM in simulated adult-sized patients. However, the pediatric BVM provides lower median tidal volumes compared to an adult BVM."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant difference in long-term outcomes or survival between patients with acute diverticulitis who underwent colonoscopy and those who did not. Additionally, no new or different diagnoses were made after colonoscopy. Therefore, the routine use of colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not appear to be necessary for management."}
{"answers": "Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.", "prediction_text": "While consensus guidelines recommend cardiovascular evaluation prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas, this study suggests that the incidence of cardiovascular side effects is low. However, further research with larger patient cohorts is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.", "prediction_text": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has shown to be highly effective in managing type 2 diabetes in obese patients, but its application in type 1 diabetes is still under investigation and research is ongoing to determine its potential as a lifelong solution."}
{"answers": "Collectively, results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information about ESC to their members.", "prediction_text": "Yes, some drivers who are aware of ESC and have experience driving vehicles equipped with it report noticeable changes in their driving behavior. However, not all drivers are aware of ESC and its benefits. Further research is needed to assess the extent and potential impact of behavioral adaptation to ESC."}
{"answers": "The results of the study demonstrate that when clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational change.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, clinical supervision can contribute to the effectiveness and professional development of allied health professionals, and may be an important factor in sustaining the workforce in the current healthcare landscape. The length, frequency, and individualized nature of supervision sessions were identified as key components of effective supervision."}
{"answers": "Both 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide mortality in Europe.", "prediction_text": "Yes, both the 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion have a significant negative influence on suicide mortality in Europe for both males and females, with a stronger effect observed for the 'social/welfare' dimension among females."}
{"answers": "While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound examination can provide valuable information in the assessment of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly in determining invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum. However, its accuracy in measuring maximum tumor thickness and differentiating invasion into the corpus spongiosum is limited."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that both health care providers and patients may require education and training to ensure proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Health care providers, including house staff and nurses, showed room for improvement in their knowledge and proficiency."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrated that the regional or global apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one level from the regional apex.", "prediction_text": "In adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebra) and coronal apex (regional or global) do not always coincide, and the difference can extend up to two levels."}
{"answers": "Generalization of the RCT sample was supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with less severe mania.", "prediction_text": "The \"Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)\" sample, recruited through media and community sources, shares similar demographic and clinical characteristics with the \"Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders\" sample obtained by consecutive new case ascertainment. However, the TEAM sample had a higher prevalence of mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality. The representativeness of the TEAM sample for child bipolar I disorder requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific issues that require further research and debate.", "prediction_text": "While there is a broad European consensus on many factors characterizing good practice in health care for immigrants, there are still disagreements within and between countries on specific issues, such as prioritizing cultural differences and consistent governance of health care services."}
{"answers": "Biochemical analysis of injured cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.", "prediction_text": "The fibronectin-aggrecan complex is present in the lavage fluid of patients undergoing surgical treatment for cervical radiculopathy caused by disk herniation, and its concentration correlates with monocyte chemotactic protein-1."}
{"answers": "Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which is indicative of improved fitness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the findings from this study suggest that affect-regulated exercise training, where intensity is based on feeling 'good', can lead to improved fitness and increased time to reach ventilatory threshold. However, the exercise intensities used were in the lower range of recommended guidelines for cardiovascular health."}
{"answers": "In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that both hepatitis G virus and TT virus may be involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease, but the prevalence of infection is higher in patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. However, the clinical significance of these infections in the development of liver damage remains unclear."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.", "prediction_text": "In this prospective study, somatic complaints were found to be a significant predictor of subsequent symptoms of depression only in women. However, other factors such as income and age were found to be more powerful predictors."}
{"answers": "Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilation index values can predict mortality in children with malignancy and ARDS within the first three days. From day 8, respiratory data's relationship to outcome is related to oxygenation efficiency."}
{"answers": "In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.", "prediction_text": "Elevated inhibin concentrations in both serum and tissue can be used as a clinical marker for hydatidiform mole, as shown by a significant increase before evacuation and a significant decline to normal levels after evacuation, with no subsequent development of persistent trophoblastic disease in patients with inhibin concentrations below the detection limit."}
{"answers": "The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.", "prediction_text": "While the most suspect curve and curve-type distribution percentage provide some diagnostic value, the combination of dynamic data using CAD in MRM offers the highest diagnostic accuracy, although the differences did not achieve statistical significance. The choice of analysis method may depend on the specific clinical context and available resources."}
{"answers": "The seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of hydatid cyst.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination is a significant reason why surgeons in northern Jordan are not adopting percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques for the treatment of liver hydatid cysts."}
{"answers": "Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during labor and delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, grandmultiparity is an independent risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, including abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, fetal macrosomia, neonatal death, postpartum hemorrhage, and blood transfusion."}
{"answers": "No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.", "prediction_text": "The identification of women with major depression in pregnancy using administrative health datasets can be challenging due to the limitations of each dataset and the potential for under-ascertainment. The study suggests that around 16% of pregnant women may have major depression based on a capture-recapture analysis, but only around 13.6% were identified by both datasets. This highlights the importance of considering the limitations of each dataset and the potential for under-ascertainment when interpreting health outcomes research based on routinely collected administrative data."}
{"answers": "These data suggest a pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are needed.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder is a stable feature over time."}
{"answers": "The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.", "prediction_text": "The number of diabetes-educated staff in a general practice is the only structural characteristic significantly associated with increased use of an IT innovation in primary care."}
{"answers": "GAPS, a simple clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be respected.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while nurses and the objective GAPS score have similar discrimination and accuracy in predicting admission at triage, the nurses' estimates overestimate the number of admissions and have poorer calibration compared to GAPS. However, when clinical certainty is high, nurses' estimates are more accurate. Combining GAPS with nurses' clinical judgment can improve the overall performance."}
{"answers": "Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in vitamin D levels between prepubertal children with celiac disease and those without the condition. However, obese children with celiac disease had lower vitamin D levels than non-obese children without the disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Granulomatous myelotoxicity and enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.", "prediction_text": "The patient described in the paper is not diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The patient is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and experiences severe systemic reactions to sulfasalazine treatment, including eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis, myelotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures."}
{"answers": "Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that certain health behaviors, such as exercise habits, dietary habits, regular blood pressure measurement, and drinking habits, can influence the utilization of healthcare resources, with healthier lifestyles being associated with fewer outpatient visits and health examinations."}
{"answers": "Parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking susceptibility and lower smoking rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study provides evidence that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with a lower likelihood of adolescent smoking susceptibility."}
{"answers": "Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that managed care may have a negative impact on the likelihood of low-income uninsured individuals having a usual source of care. However, having a usual physician is still associated with reduced unmet medical needs for both insured and uninsured populations."}
{"answers": "Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.", "prediction_text": "Topical application of ropivacaine hydrochloride in the first hour following adenotonsillectomy does not significantly reduce post-operative morbidity in pediatric patients. However, its use beyond the first hour shows statistically significant pain-relieving effects without any reported complications or systemic side effects."}
{"answers": "Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for mitral valve surgery.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that minimally invasive mitral valve repair using artificial chords is a reproducible and effective approach, with a low rate of recurrent mitral regurgitation and no need for reoperation."}
{"answers": "Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different valve types.", "prediction_text": "The effective orifice area (EOA) to patient aortic annulus area ratio can be used as a more accurate method to compare the hemodynamic performance of different bioprostheses, as it adjusts for variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions. However, in this study, there was no significant difference in EOA/patient aortic annulus area ratio between the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses."}
{"answers": "Women compared to men often delay seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that women who were alone when symptoms began and those who were not advised to call 911 had longer delays in seeking medical help for an acute myocardial infarction compared to men. Additionally, men with emergency room insurance delayed longer than men without it. However, the study did not find a significant difference in median delay time between genders."}
{"answers": "A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence that children with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) have impaired alveolar macrophage phagocytic function, which is similar to that observed in children with bronchiectasis. This dysfunction may contribute to the development of tissue damage and neutrophil persistence, suggesting that PBB could be a precursor to bronchiectasis."}
{"answers": "Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence that multi-modal cervical physical therapy can lead to substantial improvement in tinnitus complaints for some patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus, although the effect is not sustained for all patients."}
{"answers": "Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to high levels of occupational physical activity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a positive relationship exists between aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure. A 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload is associated with a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no evidence to support the occurrence of secular growth acceleration during fetal life."}
{"answers": "Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen for body mass index does not appear warranted.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no significant association between prostate specific antigen and body mass index after adjusting for age. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust prostate specific antigen for body mass index."}
{"answers": "Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the high 30-day and 1-year mortality rates following emergency laparotomy, particularly in older adults, highlight the need for prospective data collection, improvement of care, and the establishment of best practices in this area."}
{"answers": "[corrected] This observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.", "prediction_text": "The occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in a child with a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome is a rare event, and further research is needed to establish a causative link between the two conditions."}
{"answers": "The signal intensity on DWI showed no significant difference in the development of vascularization.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the use of diffusion-weighted imaging as a significant indicator of the development of vascularization in hypovascular hepatocellular lesions."}
{"answers": "General practitioners should consider using patients' first names more often, particularly with younger patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, it is generally acceptable for patients to be called by their first names by their general practitioners, but the majority of patients do not wish to reciprocate and call their doctor by their first name."}
{"answers": "Patients after ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ART patients, specifically primiparae, have a higher risk of both elective and emergency C-sections compared to spontaneous conception. Additionally, all ART groups show an enhanced risk of significant perinatal bleeding."}
{"answers": "Trauma patients have a significant complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely anticoagulate this high risk population.", "prediction_text": "The use of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients carries a risk of complications, including bleeding and hemorrhage, which can be significant and potentially life-threatening. Factors associated with an increased risk of complications include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of unfractionated heparin, and a lower initial platelet count. Patients receiving unfractionated heparin differed from those receiving fractionated heparin in several characteristics, including laboratory values and anticoagulation indications. Therefore, careful consideration and monitoring are necessary when using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients."}
{"answers": "A significant difference in dental health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that new recruits to the British Army had a significantly lower level of dental health compared to those in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. This difference was found to be associated with the sociodemographic background of Army recruits, who were more likely to come from the most deprived areas."}
{"answers": "In light of the large sample size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic and episodic headache subforms.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli."}
{"answers": "Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during clerkships.", "prediction_text": "Yes, students with low performance on preclerkship clinical performance examinations have a higher risk of failing a senior clinical performance examination. However, USMLE Step 1 scores also correlate with performance on the senior examination, but their predictive values are weaker compared to preclerkship examinations."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the public places a higher value on health care interventions aimed at preventing harms caused within the health care system compared to interventions related to individual lifestyle choices or injuries."}
{"answers": "Minimising the radiation dose to one of the parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a useful method of documenting xerostomia.", "prediction_text": "Dose reduction to one parotid gland can help minimize the risk of xerostomia, but not completely prevent it, in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancers. The study suggests that 2 out of 19 patients still experienced grade III xerostomia despite unilateral sparing."}
{"answers": "It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.", "prediction_text": "The available evidence from this study does not definitively prove that folic acid supplementation decreases methotrexate toxicity or improves its efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The decision to continue or discontinue folic acid supplementation should be based on individual patient needs and potential risks. The study suggests that some patients may experience increased toxicity when discontinuing folic acid, but the overall impact on disease activity and long-term outcomes is uncertain. Further research is needed to clarify the role of folic acid supplementation in methotrexate therapy."}
{"answers": "LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted to selected patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that laparoscopic fundectomy is a safe and effective revision surgery for patients with a residual fundus/neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, leading to improvements in GERD symptoms and additional weight loss. However, it carries a 10.5% risk of postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "VAT area measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement should be selected at this location.", "prediction_text": "Measuring visceral adipose tissue area at a level 3 cm above the lower margin of L3 can provide a good representation of visceral adipose tissue volume and body weight changes."}
{"answers": "Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.", "prediction_text": "The use of cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea has a moderate sensitivity (77.8%) and specificity (77.5%). However, its diagnostic utility remains controversial."}
{"answers": "In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is a correlation between lunar position and the time of delivery, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae, with a higher likelihood of delivery occurring on the first or second day following a full moon."}
{"answers": "Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years of \u00a3482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that financial incentives up to \u00a3400 for smoking cessation during pregnancy can be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a3482/QALY ($734/QALY), but the results are uncertain due to the potential for relapse after birth. Additional research is recommended to reduce this uncertainty."}
{"answers": "This data demonstrates the robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child with their family to the community.", "prediction_text": "The short stay or 23-hour wards in the general and academic children's hospitals evaluated in this study were effective in reducing length of stay, increasing hospital efficiency, and resulting in significant cost savings. The appropriateness of stay, adverse events, and parental satisfaction were also favorable."}
{"answers": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.", "prediction_text": "The presence of a tumor identified at surgery and negative radiological and histological findings are significant predictors of poor outcome after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. Additionally, elevated postoperative cortisol levels can indicate early failure. However, some patients may still require hormonal replacement therapy and even a second operation despite achieving long-term remission."}
{"answers": "Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical subspecialty syndromes.", "prediction_text": "Chronic functional somatic symptoms are associated with increased healthcare utilization, somatic and psychotropic medication use, and psychiatric morbidity, suggesting the presence of distinct somatic syndromes rather than a single syndrome."}
{"answers": "The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "In the majority of cases, the patient's management aligns with the recommendations of the multidisciplinary team in breast cancer. However, there are instances where discordant decisions occur, which can be considered justifiable due to patient choice, additional information, or error."}
{"answers": "We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of S. aureus bacteraemia.", "prediction_text": "The prevalence of PVL-positive Staphylococcus aureus isolates in bacteraemia cases in the UK is low (1.6%). The significance of PVL in the pathogenesis of primary bacteraemia caused by S. aureus remains uncertain. The study suggests that the majority of PVL-positive isolates are methicillin-resistant and have distinct genetic profiles."}
{"answers": "These findings are in accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through canine-assisted interventions.", "prediction_text": "The presence of a therapy dog during structured activities can enhance the therapeutic experience for children with autism spectrum disorder, leading to increased positive behaviors and decreased negative behaviors."}
{"answers": "We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects with the ACE DD genotype.", "prediction_text": "The deletion allele of the ACE gene is associated with insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects, but not in nondiabetic subjects. The insertion allele does not appear to be a candidate gene for insulin resistance in the general population."}
{"answers": "A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not an independent predictor.", "prediction_text": "The presence of postictal psychotic episodes does not appear to be a consistent predictor of the development of interictal psychotic episodes in adults with partial seizure disorders. Other factors, such as male gender and having bilateral ictal foci, may also play a role."}
{"answers": "QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high sensitivity and specificity.", "prediction_text": "Yes, corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2%. A QTcD value of 60 ms is the optimal cut-off for predicting LVH."}
{"answers": "The shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the rate of postoperative infection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, according to this study, shaving the incision site before spinal surgery increases the infection rate."}
{"answers": "The majority of EMS professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency calls.", "prediction_text": "The majority of EMS professionals (82.7%) believe that they should participate in disease prevention. However, only about a third (33.8%) of the respondents reported having provided prevention services. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of having provided prevention services include having a graduate degree, working for more than 21 years in EMS, working for the military, working 60 to 69 hours per week, and responding to zero emergency calls in a typical week. Additionally, those who had participated in prevention programs were more likely to believe that EMS professionals should participate in prevention, and those who had provided prevention services during emergency calls were more likely to think EMS professionals should provide prevention services during emergency calls"}
{"answers": "Current K/DOQI guidelines are inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "The current K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol may not be sufficient for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Only about half of the patients achieved a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of >5 ng/ml (12.5 nmol/l), and only a quarter reached a level of >30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l). Additionally, only about a quarter of patients had a >30% decrease in iPTH levels."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a correlation between pain intensity at admission and poor opioid response in cancer patients. However, patients with poor opioid response had higher values of OEImg (opioid consumption index)."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "In this retrospective study, a significant number of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the pre-HAART era and treated in a resource-limited setting were able to maintain viral load suppression over a median duration of 14 years. However, a subset of patients experienced virologic failure and required third-line ART regimens, which were associated with a higher risk of failure. These findings suggest that while treatment as prevention is feasible in resource-limited settings, ongoing monitoring and adherence to treatment are crucial to prevent the emergence of viral resistance."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that pyloric mucosal redundancy and hypertrophy may play a role in the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. However, further research is needed to establish a definitive causal relationship."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Discordant outcomes between transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) in newborns can be predicted by antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type. Infants with false-positives are more likely to be admitted into well-baby nurseries, born to mothers who attended antenatal care, or delivered vaginally. Infants with true-positives are more likely to be delivered vaginally and have severe hyperbilirubinemia. The predictive power of these factors is moderate (c-statistic=0.73)."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases at the same center may result in a lower number of procedures, shorter delay between procedures, and potentially improved disease-free survival, but it does not show a significant difference in three-month mortality or overall survival rates. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Echo-planar diffusion-weighted MR imaging can provide valuable information in differentiating certain types of primary parotid gland tumors, specifically pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin tumors, from other entities such as myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas. However, it is not able to distinguish between other histologic subtypes such as mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education strategies should be implemented.", "prediction_text": "The survey results suggest that there is a significant proportion of UK radiology departments where the service for reporting and providing expert evidence on skeletal surveys for suspected child abuse could be improved. Additionally, a considerable number of radiologists do not have adequate training or experience in this area and are not willing to provide expert evidence."}
{"answers": "The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 can reflect the inflammatory activity in the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis, with significantly lower IL-4 levels and higher TNFalpha and IL-6 levels observed in the complicated group."}
{"answers": "During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health system.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that smoking, greater waist circumference, and higher \u03b3-glutamyltransferase levels at baseline are associated with an increased risk for the conversion from optimal blood pressure to hypertension in Black South Africans. Alcohol intake and waist circumference also predict changes in central systolic blood pressure and carotid cross-sectional wall area. HIV infection, on the other hand, is inversely associated with increased blood pressure."}
{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are significant differences in self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden between Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV. The Web-based sample was younger, less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy, and had worse psychological symptom burden, while the clinic sample was older, more likely to be on antiretroviral therapy, and had similar physical symptom burden. However, employment status was the only variable significantly associated with high physical and psychological symptom burden in multivariable logistic regression models."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups can provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures, but some components showed migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1-year postoperatively. The contact surface achieved between the acetabular component and pelvis was variable."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that cardiac reoperations in octogenarians can result in improved functional status and similar quality of life to age- and sex-matched normative population, but with a significant mortality rate. The length of hospital stay is also considerable."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness, specifically those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "Open access endoscopy may result in less comprehensive preprocedural information and explanation for patients compared to those referred through a subspecialty clinic, potentially impacting patient satisfaction and follow-up care."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Uterine myomas can exhibit both growth and shrinkage during pregnancy, with a greater tendency for shrinkage in the second and third trimesters. However, a significant number of myomas can still increase in size during pregnancy."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "The increased risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood associated with measures of fetal growth restriction, such as low birth weight and small head circumference, is not fully explained by socioeconomic factors or familial effects. These factors contribute to the risk but the associations remain significant after adjustment."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "Double reading of barium enemas can increase the number of detected lesions and potentially alter clinical treatment, but it also decreases specificity and overall agreement, and requires additional time. The decision to implement double reading should consider the balance between increased detection and potential false positives, as well as the resources required."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "The vascular-guided multilayer preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications based on the findings of this clinical study. All patients had successful surgeries with favorable incision healing and no severe complications."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during primary lung cancer surgery may not be necessary as the metastasis rate is low and the staging results and prognosis are not significantly impacted."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a significant change in the trend of antiepileptic drug prescription claims following the FDA suicidality warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "There is only moderate agreement between self-reported and government records regarding motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in stroke survivors. The use of both sources of data can identify up to 56% more accidents and up to 46% more convictions."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication skills for interacting with terminally ill patients can be effectively taught through structured courses, as evidenced by improvements in participants' self-reported sense of security and communication behavior."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Peer review using a structured implicit chart review instrument can play a role in profiling quality of care, particularly for conditions with a well-established evidence base, where the reliability of a single review is higher. However, for conditions with less developed evidence bases, the reliability of peer review is lower and should be considered with caution."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "The rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions for emergency contraception in community family planning clinics is relatively high, particularly among nulliparous women. The use of adjuvant measures may improve insertion success. Further research is warranted to address this issue and improve clinical outcomes."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, the use of virtual planning and guided surgery for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps can result in significant time savings during surgery, which in turn can offset the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence to suggest that risk factors for suicidal behavior differ between individuals with major depressive and bipolar disorders."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "The use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites is associated with a low incidence of acute side effects, primarily urticaria, and no deaths, amputations, or permanent disability were reported in this study."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find any significant change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients. However, there was an improvement in New York Heart Association functional class postoperatively."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study demonstrates that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model, with the greatest effect observed at a 250 \u00b5m ablative depth."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the findings from this study suggest that there are significant issues with the storage of vaccines in the community, with many practices not adhering to recommended storage conditions and inadequate temperature monitoring."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between p53 alterations and tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in terms of reduction in tumour size and local failure in locally advanced rectal cancer."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "The evidence from this retrospective study does not provide clear support for the routine use of hyperbaric oxygenation as an adjuvant therapy for necrotizing fasciitis, as there was no significant difference in mortality rate or length of hospitalization between the HBO and non-HBO groups, and the HBO group required more surgical debridements."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) can be effective and tolerated by some adult European patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. However, the sample size was small and further research is needed to confirm these findings. Additionally, monitoring of plasma levels of zonisamide is recommended to ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse events."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a significant prognostic biomarker for poor cancer-specific survival, disease-free survival, and disease progression in patients with upper tract urinary carcinoma."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect and characterize a significant number of occult bone and cartilage injuries in the knee that may be missed on conventional radiography. However, it may not completely replace diagnostic arthroscopy as MRI may not depict all osteochondral injuries and cannot provide the same level of detail for surgical planning. The decision to use MRI or arthroscopy should be based on the clinical presentation and individual patient needs."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Cognitive dysfunction and language deficits, including dementia and aphasia, are common in motor neuron disease and should be routinely assessed in patients with this condition."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, sensation in the nasal tip gradually returns after microfat grafting, although there may be initial numbness. The extent and duration of the numbness varies and can be detected objectively and subjectively."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication disorders, such as severe to profound hearing loss and autism spectrum disorder, can impact the ability to recognize symbolic representation of emotions and movements in music. However, the specific nature of the impairment may differ between disorders. In this study, children with severe to profound hearing loss using cochlear implants showed significantly less accuracy than children with typical development and normal hearing in identifying both musical emotions and movements. Children with autism spectrum disorder did not differ significantly from the typical development and normal hearing group in this regard."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "The use of color to describe osteoarthritis pain is generally acceptable to patients, with red being commonly associated with high-intensity pain due to its symbolism of inflammation and intensity. However, the interpretability and standardization of color as a means of communicating pain to healthcare professionals remains a concern."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban patients appears to be safe, with similar rates of serious adverse events and dose intensities."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Surgical extirpation and radiation therapy have a positive impact on the survival of patients with extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, particularly for those with gastrointestinal disease. Factors such as age, gender, stage, and the use of radiation and surgery are independent predictors of survival."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Modifying the original anatomy of the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy from retrocolic to antecolic duodenojejunostomy may reduce the incidence of delayed gastric emptying. The study reports a 3% incidence of DGE in the group with no postoperative complications other than DGE, compared to 30% in the group with other postoperative complications."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is significantly associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse. The study found that women with pelvic pain were more likely to experience symptoms such as straining with bowel movement, sense of incomplete emptying, pain with bowel movement, and splinting with bowel movement."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "The expression and activation of c-kit in uveal melanoma cells suggest that it plays a role in their growth and survival. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 effectively blocks c-kit phosphorylation and induces cell death in uveal melanoma cell lines, making c-kit a potential therapeutic target."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that telmisartan may have a protective effect against hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes, as indicated by a decrease in TGF-beta immunoreactivity. However, further research is needed to confirm these results in humans."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "Based on the information provided in the study, the majority of U.S. transplant centers still exclude asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease from transplantation. However, recent advances in HIV management and prognosis suggest that this policy should be reevaluated."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "The yield and accuracy of staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are relatively low, but it can provide valuable information regarding the presence of cirrhosis and potentially change management in some cases."}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the accurate assessment and appropriate management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), as it can significantly impact risk assessment and treatment decisions. The study demonstrates that secondary pathology assessments can lead to changes in both risk assessment and treatment recommendations in a substantial number of cases."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Vaginal pH measurement from wet mount slides is not an accurate method and can lead to false positive readings due to the addition of saline. Direct measurement on fresh vaginal fluid is recommended instead."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that HIV-positive individuals have a significantly higher risk of developing both simple and plunging ranulas/oral mucoceles."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "The results of this updated meta-analysis do not support the use of central venous pressure as a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness. The correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were low and similar in both ICU and operating room settings."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, D-dimer levels do not appear to be a reliable diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in the programmed cell death (PCD) process in the lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) by undergoing specific dynamics and contributing to the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). These events ultimately lead to the remodeling of the lace plant leaves during PCD."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that transurethral catheterisation is associated with lower patient satisfaction and an increased risk of urinary tract infections, particularly in male patients. Further research is needed to explore alternative methods of bladder drainage."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "Risk stratification using the MASCC index can help identify high-risk gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever who may benefit from inpatient management, as they are more likely to experience severe complications and mortality. However, the index has a limited positive predictive value."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic and can cause damage to inner and outer hair cells and spiral ganglia cells in the cochlea."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that elderly patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are more likely to be undertreated, but aggressive therapy (surgery, radiation, or combined) can still provide significant benefits in disease-specific survival for those aged 65 to 84."}
{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not provide evidence to suggest that minimal access surgery in neonates results in less postoperative pain or reduced opioid consumption when compared to conventional surgery."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that clinical predictors alone may not be sufficient in the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes do not consistently follow the current European nutritional recommendations, particularly in regards to fiber and saturated fat intake, which may contribute to an atherogenic diet. However, there were minor changes in nutrient intake over a 7-year period, with some improvements towards recommended levels."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Patella position can influence ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with significant differences observed in mediolateral gaps between patella reduction, subluxation, and eversion positions, particularly in knee flexion. However, there is notable variability in knee flexion position and a significant portion of subluxated and everted patellae demonstrate increased or decreased gaps compared to reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA and form inhibitory synapses on CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence to suggest that gender differences in the reporting of depressive symptoms account for the higher rates of depression in women."}
{"answers": "Time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful quality indicators.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there was no significant impact of time to primary treatment on the survival of breast cancer patients. However, ethnicity and stage at presentation were significant factors associated with delayed treatment."}
{"answers": "Our findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reduced ADMA levels in young adults born preterm at extremely low birth weight are associated with an increased risk for the development of adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death, and may serve as a predictor of early endothelial dysfunction."}
{"answers": "ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can improve the prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. The addition of ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) enhances the receiver operating characteristic curves with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (P<0.0001)."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that past streptococcal infection, as indicated by elevated antideoxyribonuclease B levels, may be associated with multiple sclerosis. However, further research is needed to confirm this relationship."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) can be associated with immune dysregulation, as evidenced by the reported case of a child with AFOP and very severe aplastic anemia, who responded to immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "The opportunity for rescue antenatal corticosteroid administration is limited, as most women deliver within a week after receiving the initial dose. Factors such as premature preterm rupture of membranes, twins, and gestational age at administration are associated with an increased risk of delivering before 34 weeks."}
{"answers": "The results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is a higher prevalence of fatigue in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome compared to lupus patients, but the prevalence of fibromyalgia syndrome is not significantly different between the two groups."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Distal ureteral diameter and uretero-distal ratio are significant predictors of reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the HINT1 gene may play a role in the development of schizophrenia, particularly through interactions between sex, diagnosis, and specific genotypes. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the exact mechanism by which HINT1 contributes to the disease."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury based on current methods may not be as clinically relevant as the use of sacral sparing measurements, specifically S4-5 light touch and pin prick sensation, in predicting 1-year independent ambulation."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the findings from this systematic review suggest that there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, with significant decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter, and specific white matter regions, as well as increases in lateral ventricular volume over time."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, impaired fasting blood glucose levels are associated with an increased risk of mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The risk is lower than for patients with clinical diabetes mellitus but still significant. The study suggests that a fB-glu level of 5.6-6.1 mmol/L is associated with a relative risk of 1.9 (CI: 0.8-6.3) for 1-year mortality."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "The interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are lower than plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration. The penetration of meropenem into the interstitial fluid is estimated to be around 60-70%."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "While Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is considered an early stage, the findings from this study suggest that histology, tumor size, and the presence of a negative resection margin are significant prognostic factors for survival."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "The majority of gout patients in this study were not aware of their serum urate goal, despite having received urate-lowering therapy. Factors associated with greater odds of knowing the goal included having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and having correct answers for the other gout-specific knowledge questions. Knowledge of the serum urate goal was associated with better self-reported global health status."}
{"answers": "Despite government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often than wealthy individuals.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that government-funded, low-income vision care programs may not be sufficient in improving the utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals in Canada. The prevalence of eye care provider utilization was lower among those with financial difficulty despite adjusting for age, sex, and education."}
{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, infants born to mothers residing in rural areas have poorer neonatal outcomes, including higher mortality, compared to those born to mothers residing in urban areas in the state of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. This difference persists despite a coordinated referral and transport system."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Endothelin-1 may play a role in the development of both hypotension and rebound hypertension during hemodialysis. The study found that ET-1 levels decreased in patients with dialysis-induced hypotension and increased in those with rebound hypertension. However, it is important to note that this is just one potential factor and further research is needed to fully understand the complex hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that frozen section evaluation during thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease does not alter surgical management due to its low sensitivity for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Elderly cancer patients express different care needs compared to younger patients, with a greater emphasis on financial-insurance information, the need to talk to people with the same illness, and the need for more comprehensible information from healthcare professionals."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "The term \"globulomaxillary cyst\" is no longer considered a valid entity in dental pathology. Instead, various other conditions, such as lateral periodontal cysts, radicular cysts, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, and others, can present with similar clinical, radiological, and histological features that were previously attributed to globulomaxillary cysts."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Pre-treatment fears of recurrence and optimism are significant predictors of long-term fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer survivors."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "The presence of multiple symptoms in older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials is associated with increased admissions, complications, and functional decline. Therefore, symptoms should be taken into consideration when selecting patients for these trials."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that CPAP therapy can improve overall life quality parameters, specifically the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), in IPF patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the improvement was not statistically significant for other sleep and quality of life measures, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP therapy due to nocturnal cough and claustrophobia. Heated humidification was added to improve the"}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program has a positive impact on reducing disability in the elderly population. An increase in SSI benefits is associated with a decrease in disability rates, particularly for mobility limitations. The findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses and were not influenced by other factors such as Medicaid or marital status."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "The current study provides some evidence for the clinical identifiers of early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, but the lack of a definitive reference standard for diagnosis remains a significant limitation. Pain at the end of range of all measured active movements is the only identifier that remained significant in the final analysis."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, concerns regarding the appropriate use and dosing of cough and cold medicines in young children (under 6 years old) persist."}
{"answers": "Vitamin C reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome after wrist fractures. A daily dose of 500 mg for fifty days is recommended.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that vitamin C may have a protective effect against complex regional pain syndrome in elderly women with wrist fractures, but the effect seems to be dose-dependent and the overall preventive effect is not clear. Early cast-related complaints may also be a predictor of the development of complex regional pain syndrome."}
{"answers": "The tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that a tendency to clear one's plate when eating is positively associated with body mass index (BMI) and is an independent risk factor for obesity."}
{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "The clinical assessment of acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease has limited accuracy, as shown by a low sensitivity of 39%. Therefore, empiric chest radiography can be considered valuable in detecting clinically unsuspected cases."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there was no statistically significant difference in the quality of TME (total mesorectal excision) surgery between consultants and supervised colorectal trainees."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that there is room for improvement in the clarity, definition, and enforcement of school food policies at Dutch primary schools. Parental support and involvement are also crucial factors that need to be addressed to ensure the effectiveness of the policy."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that motion perception deficits in schizophrenia may not be solely due to eye-tracking abnormalities, as eye movements and motion perception appear to interact in this population."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in continence function or sphincter function between patients with and without anastomotic leakage after curative sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. However, slight decreases in maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance were observed in patients with anastomotic leakage."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "The presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) at the site of a traumatic cervical cord injury does not appear to significantly impact neurological outcomes, as indicated by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor scores and improvement rates. However, smaller static and dynamic canal diameters were observed in the OPLL+ group, but no correlation was found between these measurements and neurological outcomes."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, waist circumference and hip circumference scale negatively to height, after adjusting for age and race. The scaling powers are lower than that of weight to height."}
{"answers": "We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.", "prediction_text": "Pain is a common and clinically relevant problem in general adult psychiatry, with a high prevalence and significant impact on impairment and unfitness for work. Depression and a history of multiple psychiatric hospitalizations are significant risk factors."}
{"answers": "This study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping strategies.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence to suggest that age moderates the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients. Personality traits, social supports, and age were significant predictors of coping strategies, while personality disorder, education, Axis I diagnosis, and symptom severity were not."}
{"answers": "The study data suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaque.", "prediction_text": "There is a significant association between the presence of cervical cord plaques and discopathy at the same site in patients with multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Routine laboratory markers, specifically an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and an AST/ALT ratio >1, can be useful in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH). However, these markers should be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and histological findings. The presence of high-grade fibrosis is also more common in ASH and can be an independent predictor."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy delivery between patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction and those who received mastectomy alone. However, there were more complications, specifically tissue expander removals, in the IBR group."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that the inverse equity hypothesis does not hold true for cancer screening in the middle-income countries studied, as economic inequalities in screening coverage were lower or non-existent in countries with higher overall coverage."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the use of antibiotics in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity, including pain control, postoperative fever, secondary hemorrhage, or length of hospital stay."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of systematic patient-rated depression severity monitoring using the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) in clinical psychiatry practices is both helpful and feasible. It significantly influences clinical decision making and leads to treatment changes in a substantial proportion of patient contacts."}
{"answers": "There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no statistically significant difference in the treatment outcomes between sliding compression hip screw and intramedullary nail for pertrochanteric fractures."}
{"answers": "Just over half the patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and daily hygiene and inspection.", "prediction_text": "While the majority of rheumatoid arthritis patients can participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme, some may have physical limitations due to age, disease duration, and disability."}
{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality does not vary significantly between regions in Scotland, despite the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of deprivation and mortality. Deprivation remains a significant predictor of mortality in all models."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while there is some variability in the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD among therapists, certain therapist characteristics, such as effective addressing of patient avoidance, language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance, can contribute to better outcomes."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "The study found that black and minority ethnic groups are less likely to be diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants compared to white British patients. Additionally, there is an inverse relationship between neighborhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis for some ethnic groups, but not for black Caribbeans. The findings suggest that neighborhood ethnic density may play a role in depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing, but the relationship is complex and varies by ethnic group."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation in Parkinson's disease. A stronger knee extensor strength is associated with better dynamic stability and improved functional ambulation, while both are negatively correlated with disease severity."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "Preloading with colloids before positioning can help maintain systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure in neurosurgical patients during the seated position without significant changes in diastolic blood pressure or heart rate."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a difference in the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis between men and women in terms of functional outcome. However, women had a higher mortality rate and a slightly higher risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage."}
{"answers": "The rate of early infection without antibiotic prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is<1%. Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not recommended.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, the use of prophylactic antibiotics during TIVAD placement cannot be definitively concluded to be necessary, as only one out of eighty-one patients who received antibiotics incidental to the procedure developed a CLABSI. However, the small sample size and the presence of concurrent chemotherapy as a risk factor for infection should be taken into consideration."}
{"answers": "The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.", "prediction_text": "The use of autologous platelet-rich plasma gel in the surgical extraction of mandibular third molars may lead to a reduction in postoperative pain, but its effect on swelling, trismus, and bone regeneration potential is not statistically significant."}
{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant discrepancy between patient and physician assessments of Quality of Life in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Physicians tend to underestimate the impact of symptoms on patients' QoL, particularly in the domains of social limitations and emotions."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Metabolic syndrome is associated with increased heart dimensions, specifically a greater left atrial diameter, in hypertensive patients."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Elevated plasma viscosity and high initial prednisolone dose are associated with a longer duration of steroid therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica. Female sex, HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles, elevated plasma viscosity, and high initial prednisolone dose may be predictors of late development of giant cell arteritis. However, no significant predictors of relapse were identified."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that surgical resection following chemoradiotherapy may improve local control and potentially overall survival in select patients with resectable disease, but the benefits come with increased morbidity and no clear overall survival advantage. The decision to add surgery should be individualized based on patient factors and tumor response to chemoradiotherapy."}
{"answers": "Our results give first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that there is an inverse relationship between beta-endorphin levels and anxiety during alcohol withdrawal, indicating that beta-endorphin deficiency may play a role in the development of anxiety in alcoholism. However, further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between beta-endorphin and anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal."}
{"answers": "Increased private health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for age, deprivation and practice.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that increased use of private health care does not result in a reduction of demand for NHS care. Instead, it appears that those from more deprived areas are more likely to use the NHS, while those from less deprived areas are more likely to use private services."}
{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation. However, there was a slightly older mean age in women with skewing of 90% or greater."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "Yes, hospice care in nursing homes is associated with a higher likelihood of receiving regular treatment for daily pain at the end of life. However, it should be noted that a lower proportion of hospice residents received analgesics not recommended by AMDA compared to non-hospice residents."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "The study indicates that residents in an academic vascular department have limited opportunities for providing complete preoperative to postoperative care for patients, with significant differences based on case type. The highest involvement was in postoperative assessment on the ward. Emergent cases and elective cases admitted before the day of surgery had higher rates of preoperative assessment and involvement in the decision to operate. However, the overall rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care was only 57%."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, detorsion alone may be a viable option for treating ovarian torsion in children, as the ovary often shows normal follicular development post-surgery despite being judged as moderately to severely ischemic intraoperatively."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography may not provide the same image quality as full-dose for the evaluation of the abdominal aorta and pelvis."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific interventions.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, there is no evidence to suggest that unsafe sexual behavior is increasing among HIV-infected individuals. However, certain subgroups, such as females, younger individuals, those with HIV-positive partners, and those with occasional partners, are more likely to report unsafe sex."}
{"answers": "In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not entirely justified.", "prediction_text": "The present study provides evidence that chemotherapy can improve survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, supporting the clinical value of this treatment. However, it is important to consider other prognostic factors such as weight loss and ECOG score when making treatment decisions."}
{"answers": "The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.", "prediction_text": "According to the study, provider service networks in Florida's Medicaid Demonstration resulted in lower per member per month (PMPM) expenditures compared with HMOs, leading to significant savings."}
{"answers": "In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.", "prediction_text": "The Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire has a moderate sensitivity (83.3%) but low specificity (19.7%) in the detection of Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (PADAM). Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) shows better predictive value for hypogonadism. However, the questionnaire can be a useful tool in identifying potential cases for further evaluation and confirmation with biochemical tests."}
{"answers": "We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation can be used as a predictor of fetal acidosis during labor, particularly when there is a negative response to the stimulation. However, the false negative rate is higher in cases of late decelerations. The predictive value for neonatal morbidity is higher for a negative VAS response compared to fetal acidosis."}
{"answers": "Emergency US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that emergency ultrasound fellowships may have a positive impact on emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education, as evidenced by increased number of scans performed and a broader scope of bedside US applications. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.", "prediction_text": "Obesity is associated with increased injury severity and longer hospital stays in injured children, and they are more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries. However, there is no significant association between obesity and mortality."}
{"answers": "The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in select patients.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, abscesses, phlegmons, and recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis are not absolute contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in patients with Crohn's disease. However, these conditions may increase the risk of operative blood loss, longer operative time, and morbidity compared to patients without these conditions."}
{"answers": "When controlling for preoperative features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.", "prediction_text": "The year in which radical prostatectomy was performed may be a predictor of treatment outcome in prostate cancer patients before surgery, but not after controlling for standard prognostic factors. The improvement in patient outcome was observed through the mid 1990s and then appeared to level off."}
{"answers": "The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.", "prediction_text": "Women with and without a prior history of major depression have distinct risk profiles for major depression during midlife. Health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms are risk factors for first lifetime-onset major depression. Being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder are predominant risk factors for major depression recurrence."}
{"answers": "Most children undergoing congenital heart surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.", "prediction_text": "Early extubation within the first 24 hours after congenital heart surgery in children, including neonates, is associated with lower mortality and a lower rate of reintubation. However, the feasibility of early extubation depends on factors such as preoperative status, procedure, and postoperative course. Predictors of delayed extubation include preoperative mechanical ventilation, weight<5 kg, longer procedure time, and the need for postoperative inotrope support. Implementation of an early extubation strategy can lead to low rates of complications, short lengths of ICU stay, and short hospital stays."}
{"answers": "A significant association between farming and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence for an association between primary systemic vasculitis and environmental factors such as farming, occupational silica and solvent exposure, and drug and overall allergies. These findings suggest that environmental factors may play a role in the development of primary systemic vasculitis."}
{"answers": "This study that shows that adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that flexible instruments may not consistently create adequate femoral tunnel lengths of less than 20 mm at 90\u00b0 of knee flexion for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The lateral structures, including the common peroneal nerve and the lateral collateral ligament, may be at increased risk with greater knee flexion."}
{"answers": "A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of>/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should be avoided.", "prediction_text": "Yes, prolonged treatment duration in radiotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with a decreased 10-year freedom from biochemical failure. The nontreatment day ratio, which accounts for the relationship between treatment duration and total dose, was an independent predictor of biochemical failure in the low-risk group."}
{"answers": "TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.", "prediction_text": "Single-valve replacement can be considered a safe option for patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis involving only one valve, as evidenced by a high rate of survival and cure in this study. However, careful preoperative diagnosis and selection of patients is crucial to ensure accurate identification of the infected valve."}
{"answers": "Acute hepatitis C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation of preventive measures.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the present study suggests that iatrogenic transmission is the most common mode of acute hepatitis C infection in Israel."}
{"answers": "Our results suggest a protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a family history of atopy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, breast-feeding is associated with a lower rate of illness in children with a family history of atopy during the first year of life and the following three years, particularly in terms of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, digestive tract disorders, respiratory tract infections, and skin infections."}
{"answers": "Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.", "prediction_text": "Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy can improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates, particularly for those with volumes greater than 40 cc. However, the detection rate decreases as the prostate size increases. The study also suggests that whole prostate volume is an independent predictor of cancer detection."}
{"answers": "There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in morbidity, mortality, or hospitalization costs between geriatric patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture with regional anesthesia or general anesthesia. However, it is important to note that delay in surgery and ICU admission were associated with increased hospitalization costs and mortality."}
{"answers": "Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, direct mesocolon invasion should be considered as a distinct entity beyond T3 in the staging of gastric cancer. However, the prognosis after curative resection is still poorer than T3 but better than incurable cases."}
{"answers": "Genetic variants identified in the present study may be insufficient to promote early carotid atherosclerosis.", "prediction_text": "Contrary to the observational data, the results of this study do not support a correlation between low HDL-C levels due to genetic mutations and increased carotid intima-media thickness."}
{"answers": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "prediction_text": "The Turkish version of the EQ-5D demonstrates construct validity in patients with acute coronary syndrome, as evidenced by significant correlations with the MacNew heart-related quality of life scale."}
{"answers": "We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that patients with congestive heart failure who receive care from both general medicine and cardiology clinics have a better 1-year survival rate compared to those who receive care from only one type of clinic or no clinic follow-up. The findings were consistent in two separate cohorts of patients."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that the intrauterine environment influenced offspring obesity through maternal body mass index to a greater extent than paternal body mass index."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that heart transplantation can be considered in brain-dead donors with a left ventricular function assessed by transesophageal echocardiography as low as an FAC of 50%, but the outcomes may be less favorable compared to donors with an FAC above 50%. The decision to transplant should be individualized based on other factors as well."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) is a clandestine practice involving self-induced hypoxia/anoxia for sexual excitement, which can result in unintended death. Pediatricians should be aware of its potential manifestations, prevalence, and risk factors to identify, discuss, and intervene when necessary. AEA is often a reenactment of intense emotional feeling-states and can be fatal due to miscalculation of the risks involved."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, STIR imaging may not be essential for the detection of bone metastases as T1-weighted sequences demonstrate superior diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity, lesion conspicuity, and image quality at both 1.5 T and 3 T."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when assessing a seafarer's fitness is poor. The reasons for disagreement include access to additional information, different interpretation of standards, and the experience and knowledge of the MRs."}
{"answers": "In our study, we suggest that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that women with more parities have higher glomerular filtration rates during pregnancy, but it does not provide evidence that this leads to kidney damage. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term implications of this finding."}
{"answers": "Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the use of an antibacterial-loaded hydrogel as an implant coating can reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. The hydrogel effectively delivers antibacterial compounds and demonstrates both bactericidal and antibiofilm activity. The coating also shows resistance to press-fit implant insertion."}
{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity is associated with a difference in place of death among cancer patients in London. Those from Asian and African backgrounds were more likely to die in hospitals, while those from the Caribbean were less likely to die at home."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "Among women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers, those with a personal or family history of HNPCC-associated cancers have a higher likelihood of having a molecular defect associated with Lynch syndrome."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and non-invasive test.", "prediction_text": "While low birth weight is not a definitive indicator of congenital cytomegalovirus infection, as evidenced by the detection of CMV-DNA in only one of the four infected newborns in this study who were above the adopted weight limit, it may still be a risk factor. Further research is needed to establish the relationship between birth weight and congenital CMV infection."}
{"answers": "The use of instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process of care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that better process of care in ambulatory settings is associated with smaller declines in health-related quality of life scores for patients with chronic disease over a 30-month observation window."}
{"answers": "To date, the newly developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight and obese.", "prediction_text": "The current prediction equations for estimating basal metabolic rate in Chinese adults may not be accurate for a large BMI range. The new equation developed in this study, BMR (kJ/d)\u2009=\u200952.6 x weight (kg)\u2009+\u2009828 x gender\u2009+\u20091960 (women\u2009=\u20090, men\u2009=\u20091), shows improved accuracy compared to commonly used equations for the whole range of BMI and for a BMI greater than 23."}
{"answers": "This preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes examinations.", "prediction_text": "Remote physician-examiners can participate in objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) and their scores can be significantly correlated with those of on-site examiners, indicating the feasibility of using remote examination technology to bridge the gap in distributed medical education."}
{"answers": "ACR is an independent prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in women with suspected preeclampsia is a significant prognostic factor for both maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. A higher ACR is associated with an increased risk of composite adverse outcomes and reduced gestational age at delivery."}
{"answers": "The effect on venous pressures caused by the change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk of venous air embolism.", "prediction_text": "The patient's position during liver surgery does not influence the risk of venous air embolism as no significant pressure gradient was observed between the hepatic and central venous levels in any position."}
{"answers": "The observations from this study provide limited support for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests a possible association between arsenic exposure and an increased risk of diabetes mellitus among art glass workers in southeastern Sweden. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding. The risk was higher for unspecified glass workers, who may have had higher levels of exposure."}
{"answers": "Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.", "prediction_text": "The current Israeli hospital readiness guidelines for multiple casualty incidents based on 10% of bed capacity appear to be effective, as the majority of incidents did not exceed the capacity. However, the mean number of arriving casualties and the median number of casualties requiring immediate medical treatment were lower than expected. Therefore, more precise prediction of surge capacity and injury severity distribution may be beneficial for better hospital preparedness."}
{"answers": "While Italian primary care physicians appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are needed.", "prediction_text": "Primary care physicians underprescribe eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease, particularly for those with a presumptive diagnosis. However, they overprescribe it for nonulcer dyspepsia patients with a presumptive diagnosis."}
{"answers": "When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.", "prediction_text": "While phonological processing abilities, which are crucial for reading, are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, the findings from this study suggest that the right hemisphere can support reading abilities to some extent in individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy. However, the degree of reading ability varies and is influenced by factors such as the age at seizure onset and the preservation of verbal memory and vocabulary size."}
{"answers": "Improved office-based practices regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial and ethnic disparities.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reducing \"missed opportunities\" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings could significantly decrease racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination."}
{"answers": "The SPI was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated cirrhosis.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the splenoportal index (SPI) obtained from duplex Doppler ultrasonography can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A), with a high negative predictive value and sensitivity when the SPI is less than 5.0. However, further validation in larger studies is needed."}
{"answers": "This study showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.", "prediction_text": "Based on the data from this study, robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy does not appear to be less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy, as indicated by higher levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6 and CRP) and lactate in the early postoperative period."}
{"answers": "The researchers studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).", "prediction_text": "Increasing the frequency of skin care protocol application from every 12 hours to every 6 hours can lead to a significant reduction in the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients."}
{"answers": "Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patient coaching can help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. The study showed that minority patients in the experimental group had similar pain control as their white counterparts at follow-up."}
{"answers": "The association between plasma glucose levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of type 2 diabetes or its prevention.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that insulin resistance plays a significant role in the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk, as the relationship between fasting and 2-hour post-glucose load plasma glucose levels and Framingham risk score was no longer significant after adjusting for insulin sensitivity."}
{"answers": "Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.", "prediction_text": "Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia can be clinically useful, particularly in modifying the surgical approach and improving diagnosis, as it can reveal unsuspected anomalies and fistulas. The procedure is crucial in 24.2% of cases."}
{"answers": "The recently released seventh edition of the primary tumor staging system for kidney tumors is a powerful predictor of CSS. However, some of the substages identified by the classification have overlapping prognoses, and other substages include patients with heterogeneous outcomes. The few modifications included in this edition may have not resolved the most critical issues in the previous version.", "prediction_text": "The 2009 TNM edition for primary tumor classification in renal cell carcinoma was validated in a large multi-institutional cohort, and the results showed that the novel classification was an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival. However, the study had limitations, including its retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and small number of patients in some substages, suggesting that further improvements may be needed."}
{"answers": "The Young-Burgess system is useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality rate, 8.2%).", "prediction_text": "The Young-Burgess classification system has limited ability to predict mortality and non-orthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures. However, it can differentiate transfusion requirements. Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types improves its predictive ability for mortality and abdomen injury rates. The overall mortality rate remains unchanged over the past 15 years."}
{"answers": "Parity is not directly linked to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently long time interval between pregnancies.", "prediction_text": "Parity is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity during pregnancy, but this relationship is confounded by age, pregestational BMI, and weight gain. The increased risk of gestational diabetes with parity is also influenced by age and pregestational weight."}
{"answers": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the frequency-compressed conditions.", "prediction_text": "Cognitive function has a predictive role in speech recognition under normal listening conditions, but not when speech is frequency compressed."}
{"answers": "We conclude that beta1Gly49 homozygosity and TACC haplotype of ADRB2 gene, both loss-of-function genetic variations, may predispose to TTN.", "prediction_text": "The study identified an association between the beta1Ser49Gly polymorphism in the ADRB gene and an increased risk for TTN, as well as a significant association with the T-47C, A46G, C79G, and C491T (TACC) haplotype in the ADRB2 gene. These findings suggest a potential role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor encoding genes in the development of TTN."}
{"answers": "MSWM does not appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes after LAGB in our patient population.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this pilot randomized controlled trial do not support the hypothesis that participation in a medically supervised weight loss program improves weight loss outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery. However, a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively was observed. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, it appears that balloon predilatation prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) can be safely omitted without affecting early hemodynamic results or increasing complication rates."}
{"answers": "In our study; sex is not a significant predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in stroke patients following IV rt-PA.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find any significant difference in the effectiveness of IV rt-PA treatment between men and women in terms of recanalization rates and poor 3-month outcomes."}
{"answers": "Serum sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "prediction_text": "Serum can be used as an alternative to tumor tissue for analyzing EGFR mutation status in advanced NSCLC patients, with a high correlation and consistency between the mutations detected in serum and tumor samples. However, the overall survival does not significantly differ according to the EGFR mutation status in both serum and tumor samples. The response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors is significantly associated with the presence of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples."}
{"answers": "Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full potential.", "prediction_text": "Web-based systems can be effective in standardizing care in medical oncology, but their uptake and use depend on various factors including clinician roles, experience, hospital policy, and infrastructure. Proper education and training are essential for their successful implementation."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm babies.", "prediction_text": "Being small for gestational age is a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity, but the study did not find a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of severe ROP between preterm infants who were small for gestational age and those who were appropriate for gestational age. Other factors, such as weight gain from birth to the sixth week of life and the need for blood transfusions, were also identified as significant risk factors for ROP in both groups."}
{"answers": "Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a similar association with BHR.", "prediction_text": "Consumption of hamburgers and takeaway food, particularly more than once a week, is associated with an increased risk of asthma symptoms, including wheeze, in children."}
{"answers": "In patients with limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.", "prediction_text": "The study reports a moderate success rate for semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in the treatment of critical leg ischemia with insufficient venous material for a straightforward femorocrural reconstruction. The cumulative primary patency and limb salvage rates were 48.4% and 68.6% at 3 years, respectively."}
{"answers": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.", "prediction_text": "The cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method can be used to measure mesopic pupil size, but it shows moderate agreement and reproducibility when compared to infrared pupillometry, and its sensitivity and specificity for detecting pupils larger than 6 mm are moderate."}
{"answers": "Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also affect the patterns of atrophy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, different TDP-43 types in frontotemporal lobar degeneration are associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI."}
{"answers": "A set of educational interventions designed for cancer patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as of 1 year after the study.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that increased patient awareness through educational interventions does not necessarily lead to an increase in accruals to cancer-related clinical trials. However, it may help identify those who are more inclined to participate."}
{"answers": "There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that there is a significant gap between the identified falls risk and the implementation of appropriate fall prevention strategies during rehabilitation and at discharge. The study highlights the need for improvement in the assessment and management of falls risk in this population."}
{"answers": "Although most Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.", "prediction_text": "The study indicates that follow-up practices for patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices do not fully adhere to the 2008 expert consensus statement, with significant variation based on patient factors and year of implantation. However, follow-up rates have improved over time."}
{"answers": "According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize and identify the composition of renal stones.", "prediction_text": "CT attenuation values for urinary stone composition identification can vary significantly between different CT scanner models, leading to potential misidentification and limitations in accuracy."}
{"answers": "Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings from this study, PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, have different biomechanical and wound healing characteristics after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery. PRK and ASA may be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to the risk for causing keratectasia, but all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques have distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. ASA cases can still develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze, while SBK has the potential for interface wound complications."}
{"answers": "The Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and websites they enjoy.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is potential for the Internet to be used as a tool to improve sexual health awareness among young people, particularly through the use of a genitourinary medicine website and a question line for e-mailing health care professionals. However, it is important to note that at the time of this study, none of the participants reported using the Internet for health information."}
{"answers": "Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound and X-ray have their unique advantages and limitations in pediatric fracture diagnosis. Ultrasound is more accurate in detecting dislocations, while X-ray is more accurate in identifying fracture types. Neither method is definitively superior to the other overall."}
{"answers": "Although initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be performed.", "prediction_text": "Implant retention can be considered for treatment of infected TKA, but it is associated with a higher risk of infection recurrence, particularly in cases of Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene nonexchange. The decision to use implant retention or two-stage revision should be based on individual patient factors and the experience of the treating surgeon."}
{"answers": "The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that both socioeconomic and microbiological factors contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. The higher risk of bacterial vaginosis and certain pathological microflora, particularly Mycoplasma hominis, in unmarried women may play a role. However, the study also indicates that younger age and a low concentration of Lactobacillus spp. are independent risk factors for M. hominis colonization."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, concept mapping has a positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching strategy for nursing students.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the results of this study suggest that concept mapping can enhance the learning outcomes of nursing students when compared to traditional quiz methods."}
{"answers": "In this nationally representative population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV with age.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is an association between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and hypertension in women, but the relationship is attenuated after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, diabetes status, and hypercholesterolemia. However, the association was no longer significant after adjusting for age alone. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that while combining antiretroviral agents into a single dosage form (FXD) may reduce pill burden and potentially enhance medication adherence, the cost-utility analysis from a healthcare system's perspective did not find a statistically significant difference in quality of life (measured by SF-6D scores) between FXD and multiple free dose combination (FRC) in HIV/AIDS patients. However, the FXD treatment was found to be cost-effective with a high probability (>50%) of being cost-effective above the $40,000 threshold."}
{"answers": "2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.", "prediction_text": "The combination of 2-methoxyestradiol with epirubicin and carboplatin may result in an additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells, potentially allowing for lower dosages of chemotherapeutics in the treatment of ovarian cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in clinical settings."}
{"answers": "Follow-up after endometrial cancer treatment varies in Italy. In this retrospective study, women with asymptomatic recurrence have shown a better clinical outcome compared with those with symptomatic relapse. The optimal approach is actually unknown, and guidelines comparing follow-up protocols have not been established. Prospective cost-effectiveness studies are needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, imaging modalities and scheduled clinical visits are the most common methods for detecting asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. However, the presence of symptoms at recurrence is a significant predictor of survival."}
{"answers": "Lower Infundibular height could be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a good outcome from lithotripsy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a greater infundibular height is associated with a lower likelihood of successful clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy."}
{"answers": "The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical debridement is the mainstays of management.", "prediction_text": "Fournier's gangrene remains a serious condition with a significant morbidity and mortality rate despite antibiotics and aggressive debridement. Low leukocyte count at presentation may be a favorable prognostic indicator."}
{"answers": "These four cases may belong to a variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.", "prediction_text": "The findings suggest that the patients with chronic progressive cervical myelopathy and HTLV-I infection may represent a variant form of HAM/TSP, with different clinical and neuroradiologic presentations. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis."}
{"answers": "The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely accepted and safer procedure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, several factors have been identified as increasing the risk of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. These include male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications. However, on multivariate analysis, only longer operation time and the year of procedure had a significant impact on staple line leak rate."}
{"answers": "Font influenced pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity.", "prediction_text": "The title and font of participant information sheets can influence pregnant women's perceptions of an antenatal intervention, with the Double Awkward condition being perceived as more complex. However, the impact on recruitment and participation requires further investigation."}
{"answers": "Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.", "prediction_text": "There is no consensus among breast surgeons regarding the most common surgical practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients undergoing breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer. The practices vary widely, and there is a lack of standardization in intraoperative margin analysis and decision-making for reexcision."}
{"answers": "The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold lesions.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that both genuine and sham acupuncture resulted in improvements in vocal function and perceived quality of life for individuals with phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. However, only genuine acupuncture resulted in structural improvements, specifically a reduction in the size of vocal fold lesions. These findings support the efficacy of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies."}
{"answers": "A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying \u226534 weeks, is not associated with better outcomes.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a statistically significant difference in maternal and perinatal outcomes between cesarean and vaginal delivery in women with eclampsia."}
{"answers": "Based on data derived from self-reported health conditions, and not withstanding the limitations of such a study, we conclude that there is good evidence to suggest that individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease are at higher risk of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and vice versa.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease, with a higher prevalence of periodontal disease observed in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis compared to those without."}
{"answers": "Present audit shows that the process of implementation of labor analgesia was quick, successful and safe, notwithstanding the identification of one cluster of women with suboptimal response to epidural analgesia that need to be further studies, overall pregnant womens'adhesion to labor analgesia was satisfactory.", "prediction_text": "The implementation of epidural analgesia for labor has shown significant increase in usage and positive patient and caregiver satisfaction. However, the effectiveness of analgesia may vary between individuals, as evidenced by the identification of two clusters with different responses to epidural analgesia. Therefore, while the standard of effective analgesia is reachable for many women, individual variability should be taken into account."}
{"answers": "The residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national survey of family and general practitioners.", "prediction_text": "The patient characteristics, reasons for visit, diagnoses, and utilization patterns observed at family practice residency training sites in northeast Ohio are similar to those reported in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, indicating that family practice training sites closely resemble community practice."}
{"answers": "Our findings suggest that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with lipid levels, specifically low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), in postmenopausal women undergoing hormone therapy (HT). Specifically, the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism and one ESR2 gene haplotype have been identified as significant in this regard."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous cardiovascular disease.", "prediction_text": "The presence of peripheral arterial disease, as assessed by ankle-arm index, does not predict cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes. Other factors, such as low hemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy, and poor mobility conditions, are more strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality."}
{"answers": "The data demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that elderly persons in Austria are not consistently adequately protected against infectious diseases by vaccinations, despite some receiving regular vaccinations. Factors contributing to this include inconsistent adherence to recommended vaccination strategies and suboptimal immune response."}
{"answers": "The introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge planning, but at additional cost.", "prediction_text": "The study found that a dedicated discharge coordinator can improve the quality of discharge planning, reduce problems experienced by patients after discharge, and enhance patient satisfaction. However, it did not result in more timely or effective provision of community services or improve the appropriateness or efficiency of bed use."}
{"answers": "Local anesthesia is not required to lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, local anesthesia does not significantly reduce pain intensity during MR arthrography of the shoulder. However, there is a significant difference in subjective pain perception between men and women."}
{"answers": "A routinely inserted ENBD tube did not improve the clinical course, despite patients having to endure increased procedure time and discomfort, and the insertion would therefore be unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, there is no significant difference in the recurrence rate of cholangitis or length of hospital stay between patients with choledocholithiasis-induced acute cholangitis who underwent endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones with or without the insertion of an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube. However, the procedure time was longer and discomfort score was higher in the ENBD group. Therefore, the routine use of ENBD tube after endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones in patients with choledocholithiasis-induced cholangitis cannot be recommended based on this"}
{"answers": "Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.", "prediction_text": "This study suggests that there may be a hereditary factor contributing to the development of nasal polyposis in this particular family, as a higher prevalence of the condition was observed compared to the general population. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding."}
{"answers": "Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by non-emergency DBE.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that the combined use of emergency double-balloon enteroscopy and real-time viewing capsule endoscopy is a feasible approach for the management of acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the detection and treatment of Dieulafoy's lesions."}
{"answers": "Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux surgery.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the retrospective study found that patients with well-controlled gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery experienced significant improvements in quality of life as measured by three different questionnaires."}
{"answers": "Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based medical education in these areas of workforce need.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients in regional and rural Australia are generally willing participants in community-based medical education, with a positive attitude towards their role in teaching medical students."}
{"answers": "Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed.", "prediction_text": "Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with a reduced aerobic fitness in individuals with severe sleep apnea, as indicated by a lower maximum oxygen consumption during cycle ergometry. However, individuals with less severe sleep apnea may exhibit increased aerobic fitness compared to the general population."}
{"answers": "Pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that didactic textual forms of pictorial warning labels on cigarette packages may be more effective in addressing smoking-related health disparities among individuals with higher educational attainment. However, further research is needed to determine if these findings can be generalized to other populations and to explore the impact of warning labels on smoking behavior."}
{"answers": "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not supported.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites and hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype."}
{"answers": "We suggest that regardless of family history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant association between family history of hyperlipidemia and serum lipid levels in school children. Therefore, family history alone may not be a reliable indicator for cholesterol screening in this population."}
{"answers": "These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that digoxin use may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer, particularly in those with frequent PSA tests. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the observational nature of the study and the need for further research to confirm these results."}
{"answers": "GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that growth hormone replacement therapy may not significantly reduce all-cause mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency. However, it does indicate that women with GHD have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, even after adjusting for other risk factors."}
{"answers": "It seems quite admissible and justified to encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment evaluations.", "prediction_text": "Student examiners can be considered as reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, but there may be some differences in student performance and evaluation between student and faculty examiners, with small effect sizes."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "The presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter and perimuscular connective tissue of the anal canal in females suggests a potential hormonal influence on anal continence. Further research is needed to determine the role of these hormones in the development and maintenance of anal incontinence."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant difference in the improvement of overactive bladder symptoms between women undergoing midurethral sling alone and those undergoing concomitant midurethral sling and anterior/apical repair."}
{"answers": "An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the presence of sublingual varices is associated with an increased risk of hypertension. However, the positive predictive value is moderate, and a definitive diagnosis of hypertension should be made through standard blood pressure measurement methods."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians are accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using both visual and auditory information or just visual information. However, under the auditory-only condition, all subjects were reliable but less accurate compared to the other two groups. Blind subjects were the least accurate in their street crossing decisions under the auditory-only condition."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, a scrotal approach to the treatment of both palpable and impalpable undescended testes can be considered a viable first choice due to its high success rate in diagnosing and treating the condition, as well as its low complication rate."}
{"answers": "Center differences in enteral feeding advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that rapid enteral feeding advancement in very low birth weight infants may be associated with a lower rate of sepsis and less use of central venous lines and antibiotics compared to slow advancement. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes."}
{"answers": "There appears to be no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.", "prediction_text": "The sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery does not significantly influence distal embolisation. However, current smoking is a significant risk factor for embolisation."}
{"answers": "GP hospitals seem to reduce the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as occupied bed days.", "prediction_text": "Yes, populations with access to general practitioner hospitals have lower rates of admissions and occupied bed days in general hospitals. This effect is most pronounced for patients with certain diagnoses, such as respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, cancer, and fractures."}
{"answers": "The EBP unit was associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.", "prediction_text": "The study provides evidence that implementing evidence-based practice (EBP) in a hospital unit led to significant improvements in patient mortality and length of stay, despite similar patient populations and no significant differences in doctor performance prior to reorganization."}
{"answers": "Although travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distance to provider is associated with both later stage at diagnosis and longer time-to-treatment for breast cancer and colorectal cancer Medicaid patients."}
{"answers": "Our results indicate that training managers in transformational leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy was not found to be the explanation.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study do not support the hypothesis that self-efficacy mediates the relationship between transformational leadership behaviors and healthcare workers' sleep quality."}
{"answers": "The use of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs to be continued.", "prediction_text": "Ultrasound can be a useful objective tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of constipation in children, particularly in determining rectal diameter and fecal load. However, it should be noted that the rectal diameter may not normalize after treatment despite improvement in symptoms. The study suggests a cutoff point of 2.44 cm for rectal diameter in diagnosing constipation, but further research is needed to establish the long-term utility of this measurement."}
{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "The available literature and the findings from this study do not provide conclusive evidence that escalating the apical dose from 100 Gy to 160 Gy significantly improves treatment outcomes for posterior uveal melanomas treated with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy. The choice of dose prescription should be based on a careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "The use of exogenous epinephrine during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest may improve the efficacy of the procedure by increasing aortic and coronary perfusion pressures, and may increase the rate of return of spontaneous circulation."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a tendency for reviewers to rate manuscripts higher when they are cited in the manuscript, but the effect is small and may be confounded by the overall quality of the manuscript. The authors were encouraged to add citations to the reviewer's work in only a small percentage of cases."}
{"answers": "Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in reducing readmissions or length of stay.", "prediction_text": "Yes, nurse-led preoperative education can reduce anxiety in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it may also lead to a lower incidence of chest infections. However, no significant difference in length of stay or readmission was found."}
{"answers": "Improving hospital efficiency by shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected readmission rates.", "prediction_text": "The study did not find a consistent correlation between decreasing lengths of stay and increased readmission rates or mean number of physician visits for the four diagnostic categories studied. However, the readmission rate for uterine or adnexal procedures increased significantly in the second year after the decrease in length of stay. The findings suggest that shorter lengths of stay do not necessarily lead to decreased quality of care for these specific diagnostic categories. However, it is important to note that the study did not examine all possible outcomes or diagnostic categories."}
{"answers": "Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that a solitary kidney is not more resistant to ischemia compared to a paired kidney. In fact, the solitary kidney may experience more severe damage and a longer recovery period."}
{"answers": "Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require prolonged intravenous therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulas every 48 hours significantly decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral thrombophlebitis. The highest risk for developing PVT is on day 3."}
{"answers": "We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "The use of 3-phase bone scintigraphy in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot can be considered as an option, but it is not yet a widely accepted or definitive guideline method due to the need for further research on its cost-effectiveness, morbidity, and long-term outcomes."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "At baseline, there is a significant association between lower socioeconomic status and poorer quality of life in lung cancer patients, but this difference does not persist at the three-month follow-up assessment."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that there is a correlation between a resident's perceived technical skill and the number of instructions they give to their assistant during a simulated small bowel repair. Those who rate their skills lower tend to give more instructions, which may be a compensatory strategy. However, it does not directly establish a causal relationship between leadership skills and technical skill."}
{"answers": "The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and the aortic arch index.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the anatomy of the aortic arch, specifically the aortic arch angle, is significantly associated with the severity of traumatic aortic injury. The aortic arch angle is a predictor of type III damage."}
{"answers": "Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not identify all children with pathologic radiographs.", "prediction_text": "The clinical variables assessed during the initial episode of bronchospasm do not accurately predict the presence of pathologic radiographs. The study identified only a significant difference in pretreatment oxygen saturation between the two groups. The discriminant analysis had limited predictive power for pathologic radiographs."}
{"answers": "The results showed no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's medical and dental history.", "prediction_text": "The present study suggests that there is an increase in the severity of sleep bruxism, specifically in terms of burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration, during the second night. This finding indicates that there may be a first night effect on sleep bruxism."}
{"answers": "Athletes engaged in competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in non-competitive sports.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in athletes may decrease over time. However, the sample size was small and further research is needed to confirm these findings."}
{"answers": "A well developed collateral circulation does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.", "prediction_text": "The present study does not support the hypothesis that a well-developed collateral circulation predisposes to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. Other factors, such as stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history, were found to be more predictive of restenosis."}
{"answers": "We conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.", "prediction_text": "The results of this study suggest that the survival and function of kidneys from elderly donors in young recipients are comparable to those from younger donors and donor age should not be a determining factor in kidney transplantation decisions. However, creatinine levels were slightly but significantly higher in the elderly donor group."}
{"answers": "Many patients do not understand their ED care or their discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension and recall.", "prediction_text": "A significant number of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension of their ED care and instructions, but a majority of these patients were not aware of their deficiencies."}
{"answers": "The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the development of the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" during and after CPB. Despite these changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal postoperative recovery.", "prediction_text": "The findings from this study suggest that temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass does have an effect on perioperative and postoperative thyroid function, as evidenced by changes in TT4, TT3, free T3, rT3, and TSH levels. Therefore, it can be concluded that cardiopulmonary bypass temperature does contribute to the development of postoperative euthyroid sick syndrome."}
{"answers": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).", "prediction_text": "Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, mortality, CV mortality, and arrhythmic death. The ORIGIN trial provides evidence for this relationship."}
{"answers": "EDWS is a safe and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated with conventional MED.", "prediction_text": "Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of portal hypertension, with a lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis and comparable recurrence rates of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage to modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy."}
{"answers": "Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.", "prediction_text": "Yes, certain preoperative factors such as a prior history of surgical pain, duration and intensity of preoperative pain, and depression can be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain. However, it's important to note that not all patients with these risk factors will experience intense postoperative pain."}
{"answers": "The general practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a statistically significant correlation between general practice selection scores and performance in the MRCGP examinations. The correlation was found to be moderate for both the applied knowledge test (AKT) and the clinical skills assessment (CSA) elements."}
{"answers": "Although the association of prostate and lung cancer is uncommon, the possibility of synchronous tumors should be considered in patients with urinary and pulmonary symptoms suggestive of neoplasm. It is important to determine if the lesion is a metastasis, since the prognosis depends on the second tumor.", "prediction_text": "The presence of both prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion does not necessarily indicate that they are different diseases. The association of these conditions may be due to the advanced stage of underlying malignancies, such as prostate and lung cancer."}
{"answers": "The practice of intensive observation for the first transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.", "prediction_text": "Based on the findings of this study, intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients is not necessary for the majority of cases, as only mild reactions occurred during the initial transfusion and none required ICU management. However, severe reactions can still occur during subsequent transfusions and close monitoring should be maintained for high-risk patients."}
{"answers": "There is no indication of a rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.", "prediction_text": "The study suggests that short-term treatment with lansoprazole may lead to a rebound aggravation of symptoms, as indicated by higher symptom scores during the placebo period after the treatment period. However, the difference was not statistically significant for all symptom scores."}
{"answers": "Our long-term study showed significantly better (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.", "prediction_text": "The long-term outcomes of transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) and conventional transabdominal pull-through (ABD) for Hirschsprung disease (HD) are not identical. The study found that continence was better in the ABD group, while stool pattern was better in the TERPT group. However, overall scores were similar. The difference in age at interview between the two groups may have influenced the results, but after controlling for age, the difference in long-term scoring outcome was not significant."}
{"answers": "The current study revealed an increase in health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish population.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prevalence of health care services use, specifically general practitioner visits, has significantly increased among elderly people from 2001 to 2009. However, the increase was greater for men than for women. Additionally, certain factors such as lower educational level, worse self-rated health, chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and disability were associated with a higher use of health care services. Men also had a higher probability of being hospitalized than women, even after adjusting for confounders."}
{"answers": "It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing delayed funeral.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the findings from this study suggest that Raksi, a homemade alcohol, can be used as a temporary alternative for preserving dead bodies due to its preservative, bactericidal, and disinfectant properties. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness is limited to up to 72 hours."}
{"answers": "The Holmium:YAG laser is an ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate and low morbidity.", "prediction_text": "Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy is an effective and relatively safe modality for the treatment of ureteral stones, with a high success rate and low complication rate. However, it is not definitively the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter as other modalities may also have similar efficacy and safety profiles."}
{"answers": "Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA patients.", "prediction_text": "The present study did not find a significant correlation between the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents and the grade of ultrasound-detected synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."}
