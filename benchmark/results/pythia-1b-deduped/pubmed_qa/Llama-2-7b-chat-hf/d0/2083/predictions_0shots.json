More insight into the mechanisms of the development of gluten tolerance may help to distinguish those CD patients that might not require life-long GFD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult patients with celiac disease can develop tolerance to gluten, with a significant proportion of patients showing tolerance to gluten after a gluten-free diet (GFD) for more than 10 years."}
{"answers": "No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged<6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers are appropriate in the South African context, with the exception of the micronutrient supplements. The study found that PM and FM provided inadequate amounts of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine, and that the preparation time of the replacement milks was longer than recommended. Additionally, the study found that the commercial formula provided more than adequate amounts of vitamin D, and that the fresh milk preparation took longer than recommended. These findings suggest that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers may not be appropriate in"}
{"answers": "We have shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) affect the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients, with a negative association between eosinophil counts and dyspnea."}

{"answers": "PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an \"atypical\" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, as it has high 5-HT2 occupancy and greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D2) occupancy, and a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when its D2 occupancy exceeds 80%."}
{"answers": "In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of<or = 1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel during the infusion.", "prediction_text": "No, continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine does not impair uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes."}
{"answers": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma is a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)."}
{"answers": "Memory provocation increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.", "prediction_text": "Yes, memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT can be used as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease, with a significant reduction in regional cerebral blood flow in the left parietal cortex observed in the AD group compared to healthy elderly."}

{"answers": "The incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.", "prediction_text": "No, post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage is not a preferred night-time event. The study found that post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage occurred in 71.2% of cases in the night-time and 28.8% in the day-time."}
{"answers": "Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in asthma care.", "prediction_text": "Yes, physician estimates of asthma severity are less accurate in black patients than in white patients. Black patients are more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated, and this underestimation is associated with poorer quality asthma care."}
{"answers": "Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.", "prediction_text": "Yes, laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly."}
{"answers": "This study has shown that mailing out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not sufficient to lead to a change in practice.", "prediction_text": "No, the study found that mailing out a summary of current evidence does not lead to a change in practice among general surgeons. The study found that the use of prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resections was not significantly different between the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases support the latter possibility.", "prediction_text": "No, the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is not apoptotic. The study found that the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin fragment, fractin, did not detect apoptotic cell death in temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS."}
{"answers": "Golytely was more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS \u2265 7) and higher adenoma detection.

Studies with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a significant difference in the adenoma detection rate between Golytely and MiraLAX. Golytely had a higher rate of a BBPS score \u2265 7 (82.5% vs. 67.8%, P = 0.02) and a higher adenoma detection rate (16.1% vs. 14.0%, P = 0.04)."}
{"answers": "Patient's age (>60 y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "No, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not predict the neoplastic nature of a polyp."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation (R14C) is a link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation."}

{"answers": "For risk stratification in emergency surgical patients, it is essential to measure the APACHE II score before surgical treatment. Longitudinal APACHE II scoring reveals continuous improvement of the score in surviving patients but has no therapeutic relevance in the individual patient.", "prediction_text": "No, the APACHE II score is not a reliable marker of physiological impairment in emergency surgical patients. The study found that the APACHE II score was not independent of the effects of treatment and might lead to considerable bias in the comparability of defined groups of patients and in the evaluation of treatment policies."}
{"answers": "The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.", "prediction_text": "Yes, perforation of the appendix is a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The study found that appendectomy is associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, with an odds ratio of 4.8 (95% CI 1.5-14.9) for tubal infertility."}

{"answers": "While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits of implementing the \"test and treat\" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the \"test and treat\" policy.", "prediction_text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is not yet ready to cope with the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). The introduction and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has drastically changed the natural history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future. The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. The introduction and widespread use of ART has been associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes, and overt diabetes, insulin resistance, and hyperlact"}
{"answers": "In summary we believe sudden onset chest wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.", "prediction_text": "Yes, chest wall rigidity is a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse."}

{"answers": "Our results suggest that people do not attach a simple fixed premium to \"safety-related\" interventions but that preferences depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the public's valuation of health care interventions is affected by the responsibility of the health care system. Participants valued interventions to prevent hospital-acquired infections more highly than genetic disorders, but drug errors were valued similarly to genetic disorders. Additionally, interventions related to lifestyle and sports injuries were given less weight than genetic disorders."}

Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in self-reported physical and psychological symptoms between the Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV."}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in total hip arthroplasty (THA) for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. The study found that the reconstruction with oversized cups provided initial stability in THA for 12 of the 30 patients who underwent immediate THA, with a median proximal migration of 0.83 mm and sagittal rotation of 1.3\u00b0."}
{"answers": "Despite high perioperative mortality, results document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 1138-1144.", "prediction_text": "No, cardiac reoperations in octogenarians do not really benefit, as the study found that the majority of patients who underwent reoperations were elderly and had a higher mortality rate."}
{"answers": "Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients with serious mental illness (SMI) are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care compared to other patients."}
{"answers": "Patients undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results to the patient.", "prediction_text": "No, open access endoscopy does not close the door to an adequately informed patient. The study found that patients referred for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic had significantly less information to help them identify the procedure and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure compared to patients referred from a GI subspecialty clinic."}
{"answers": "Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, uterine myomas do grow during pregnancy, with a mean increase in volume of 69%+/-11% between the second and third study periods."}
{"answers": "We found that all of the studied dimensions of restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by socioeconomic or familial factors.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the associations between birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood are confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects."}
{"answers": "Although feasible, double reading of barium enemas does not improve sensitivity for detection of polyps and produces a higher false-positive rate.", "prediction_text": "No, double reading of barium enemas is not necessary, as the study found that adding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315, and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients."}
{"answers": "The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a novel surgical approach to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can improve access and reduce complications, as demonstrated in the study."}
{"answers": "The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.", "prediction_text": "No, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer surgery. The study found that the metastasis rate of station 9 was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations, and this was correlated with the location of the tumor, the presence of metastasis to intrapulmonary lymph nodes, and the TNM stage of the tumor."}
{"answers": "During the time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the study population.", "prediction_text": "No, there was no significant change in antiepileptic drug prescription claims following the FDA warning."}
{"answers": "In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the self-reported data from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) and the self-reported data from the study participants were not always accurate, with a high degree of disagreement between the two sources of data."}
{"answers": "The realized communication skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can be taught.", "prediction_text": "Yes, communication with terminally ill patients can be taught, with a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses in Rhineland-Palatinate."}
{"answers": "For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course illnesses.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a role for peer review in assessing the quality of care for chronic disease, particularly for conditions in which the evidence base for practice is more developed. The study found that the reliability of a single physician review was low for diabetes and hypertension, but higher for COPD and a collection of acute conditions. However, the reviewers collectively were able to distinguish more differences in the quality of care between patients, and the higher reliability is a result of the reviewers collectively being able to distinguish more differences in the quality of care between patients."}
{"answers": "The high rate of unsuccessful IUD insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of unsuccessful IUD insertions.", "prediction_text": "Yes, failed IUD insertions in community practice are an under-recognized problem, with a significant proportion of women experiencing unsuccessful insertions."}
{"answers": "Even in capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent or milled plates are financially viable.", "prediction_text": "Yes, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable, as the time saved during surgery and the reduction in the cost of planning and cutting-guide production resulted in a significant reduction in the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production."}
{"answers": "Bipolarity does not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without regard to mood polarity.", "prediction_text": "No, there are no differences in the risk factors for suicidal behavior by affective disorder polarity."}
{"answers": "The administration of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are uncommon.", "prediction_text": "No, the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites does not result in serious acute side effects."}
{"answers": "Although endomyocardial fibrosis patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in diastolic function, may be operational.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant change in quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion after fibrous tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis patients."}
{"answers": "This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model. The study found that the Er:YAG laser at 500, 250, 50, and 25 \u00b5m ablative depth over a 400 cm2 area on the abdomen resulted in detectable levels of lidocaine and its metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) in the serum, with peak levels observed at 250 \u00b5m, compared to 500 \u00b5m, 50 \u00b5m, and 25 \u00b5m. These findings suggest that fractional lasers can enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an in vivo animal model."}
{"answers": "Vaccines were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining the \"cold chain\" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a successful immunisation programme.", "prediction_text": "The study found that only 16% of general practices and child health clinics in the study were aware of the appropriate storage conditions for vaccines, and only one of these practices was monitored daily. Additionally, only one of the eight practices selected for monitoring of refrigeration temperatures was able to maintain the temperature range to which vaccines were exposed. These findings suggest that there is a need for improved awareness and monitoring of vaccine storage conditions in the community."}
{"answers": "p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.", "prediction_text": "No, p53 alterations can not be used to predict tumor response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer."}
{"answers": "The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.", "prediction_text": "No, hyperbaric oxygenation therapy is not indicated for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in this study. The mortality rate was similar between the two groups, with a 36% mortality rate in the HBO group compared to 25% in the non-HBO group."}
{"answers": "High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients can be treated with higher doses of zonisamide (ZNS) (up to 1 year) with a good safety and efficacy profile."}
{"answers": "In conclusion, high Ki-67 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.", "prediction_text": "Yes, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC)."}
{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee. The study found that MRI can identify bone bruises, subchondral and osteochondral injuries, as well as associated bone and cartilage damage, in a significant proportion of patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma."}
{"answers": "The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.", "prediction_text": "Yes, dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease are an underrecognized association, with a prevalence of 28% in the study population."}
{"answers": "Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected to occur over a 3-month period.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the sensation returns to the nasal tip after microfat grafting."}
{"answers": "Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions focusing on emotions or movement.", "prediction_text": "No, communication disorders do not extend to musical messages. The study found that children with severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants) were less accurate in identifying musical emotions and movements compared to children with typical development and normal hearing."}
{"answers": "For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patients can use color to describe osteoarthritis pain, with the majority of participants choosing red to describe high-intensity pain."}
{"answers": "It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.", "prediction_text": "Yes, intensive chemotherapy is safe for rural cancer patients, with a lower rate of febrile neutropenia and a lower rate of diarrhoea in the breast cancer subgroup."}
{"answers": "Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.", "prediction_text": "Yes, surgery or radiation therapy for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers (EPSCC) significantly improves survival compared to those with pulmonary small cell carcinoma (P < 0.001)."}
{"answers": "DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative complications rather than to pylorus preservation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) is related to pylorus preservation, with a higher incidence observed in patients who underwent antecolic duodenojejunostomy."}
{"answers": "In women with POP, the symptom of pelvic pain is associated with the presence of defecatory symptoms.", "prediction_text": "Yes, pelvic pain is associated with defecatory symptoms in women with pelvic organ prolapse."}
{"answers": "The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.", "prediction_text": "Yes, c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells is a potential therapeutic target. The study found that c-Kit is strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells, and that treatment with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, leads to cell death. These findings suggest that c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells may be a potential therapeutic target."}
{"answers": "Results suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant TGF-beta1 down-regulation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes."}
{"answers": "The great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.", "prediction_text": "No, all human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with end-stage renal disease should not be excluded from transplantation. The survey found that most centers would not consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient who refuses HIV testing, and that the vast majority of responding centers would not consider transplanting a kidney from a cadaveric or living donor into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is otherwise a good candidate for transplantation."}
{"answers": "The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.", "prediction_text": "No, staging laparoscopy (SL) is not useful in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the following reasons:"}
{"answers": "Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the management of DCIS.", "prediction_text": "Yes, expert breast pathology assessment is necessary for the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The study found that inter-observer agreement was high for the main pathologic features of DCIS, and that secondary pathology assessments can contribute to a change in the assessment of local recurrence risk and treatment recommendations."}
{"answers": "Vaginal pH should be measured by bringing the pH strip in direct contact with fresh vaginal fluid without first adding saline.", "prediction_text": "Yes, vaginal pH can be measured from the wet mount slide."}
{"answers": "This study presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease.", "prediction_text": "Yes, oral mucocele/ranula is another human immunodeficiency virus-related salivary gland disease, with a higher prevalence of HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative patients."}
{"answers": "There are no data to support the widespread practice of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid resuscitation should be abandoned.", "prediction_text": "No, the central venous pressure does not predict fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing cardiac surgery."}
{"answers": "Increased D-dimer levels should not be considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.", "prediction_text": "No, D-dimer levels do not become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis. The study found that D-dimer levels were not significantly different between histopathologic study groups, and there was no significant difference in the ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper limit."}
{"answers": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mitochondria play a role in remodeling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death. The study found that mitochondrial dynamics are important for the progression of PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis, with different mitochondrial stages showing different characteristics and dynamics."}
{"answers": "Our study emphasised the discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during laparotomy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transurethral catheterisation is the ideal method of bladder drainage, as it is associated with a lower incidence of clinically significant urinary tract infections compared to other methods such as transurethral catheterisation."}
{"answers": "Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.", "prediction_text": "No, risk stratification of gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever (NF) is not useful in terms of predicting mortality or severe complications."}
{"answers": "Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.", "prediction_text": "Yes, halofantrine is ototoxic, as it can cause hearing loss in guinea pigs."}
{"answers": "Proportionally fewer elderly patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age as shown by our survival analysis.

{"answers": "Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid doses.", "prediction_text": "No, minimal access major surgery in the newborn does not hurt less than conventional surgery of esophageal atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)."}
{"answers": "Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.", "prediction_text": "No, clinical predictors are not adequate in the identification of cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism."}
{"answers": "European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.", "prediction_text": "Yes, European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, with lower reported protein, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intakes compared to those without diabetes."}
{"answers": "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.", "prediction_text": "Yes, patella position significantly influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, with a smaller gap in patella eversion position compared to the gap in patella reduction position."}
{"answers": "We have thus provided compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.", "prediction_text": "Yes, mossy fibers release GABA."}
{"answers": "Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms.

These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.", "prediction_text": "Yes, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects. The study found that ECL positivity was associated with a higher risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years of follow-up, and that adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P<0.0001)."}
{"answers": "These findings indicate that a relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are necessary.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis."}
{"answers": "Aplastic anemia is associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is the expression of immune dysregulation, as it can be observed in children with severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) and can be fatal in some cases."}
{"answers": "Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study suggests that women who received antenatal corticosteroid (AC) for premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM) may have a higher likelihood of remaining pregnant 1 week after AC administration, compared to those who delivered within 24 hours after AC."}

A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a link between primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) and fatigue, with a higher prevalence of fatigue in patients with pSS who also have fibromyalgia (FM)."}
{"answers": "UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, distal ureteral diameter (UD) can predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The study found that UDR was a significant predictor of reflux resolution, with a higher UDR associated with a higher likelihood of reflux resolution."}
{"answers": ": Data from both association and expression studies suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate genes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene is a candidate for schizophrenia. The study found that the expression level of HINT1 was significantly different between postmortem brain cDNAs from schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls, and that these differences were sex-dependent."}
{"answers": "Out of the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the determination between complete and incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is clinically relevant, as it can help predict 1-year independent ambulation. The study found that the combination of only voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 light touch (LT) and pin prick (PP) sensory scores (AUC: 0.906, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.871-0.941) showed significantly better discriminating results in prognosticating 1-year independent ambulation compared to the use of currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain changes should now be the focus of investigation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there are progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, with significant decreases in volume in specific brain regions over time, such as the frontal white matter, parietal white matter, and temporal white matter, and larger increases in lateral ventricular volume."}
{"answers": "The elevated risk of death after CABG surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.", "prediction_text": "Yes, even impaired fasting blood glucose (IFG) levels preoperatively are associated with increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The study found that patients with IFG had a higher mortality risk compared to those with normal fasting blood glucose (fB-glu) levels. The relative risk of 30-day and 1-year mortality was 1.7-2.9, with IFG, 2.8-1.9, and 1.6-4.3, respectively, compared to those with normal fB-glu levels."}
{"answers": "This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible pathogens (MIC\u22644 mg/L).", "prediction_text": "No, interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are not equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy."}
{"answers": "Despite advances in early diagnosis and surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size<or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.", "prediction_text": "Yes, Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is an early stage, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 63% in this study."}
{"answers": "There is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers treating gout patients.", "prediction_text": "No, gout patients do not know their goal for serum urate (SU) levels."}

{"answers": "Premature births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in neonatal intensive care than urban infants.", "prediction_text": "Yes, rural or urban residence is associated with poorer neonatal outcomes in premature birth, with a higher mortality rate observed in infants born to rural mothers."}
{"answers": "Altered ET-1 levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays a role in the hemodynamic changes during hemodialysis. The study found that pre-dialysis levels of ET-1 were significantly higher in dialysis patients compared to the controls, and post-dialysis levels were not significantly changed in any of the three HD groups. However, the post-dialysis ET-1 level was significantly lower in the group with rebound hypertension compared to the other two groups."}
{"answers": "While FS was commonly used in patients undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not be performed in these patients.", "prediction_text": "No, frozen section does not alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease."}
{"answers": "Elderly patients have informational and relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need to talk to people with the same illness.", "prediction_text": "Yes, elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared to younger ones, with the most frequently expressed needs being financial-insurance information, communication with doctors and nurses, and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians."}
{"answers": "According to the results of our study and the data from the international literature, the entity globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.", "prediction_text": "Yes, globulomaxillary cysts are a real entity, and they are not a new entity, but rather a variant of the previously described \"globulomaxillary cyst\" that was first described in the 19th century."}
{"answers": "Although components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear reported prior to treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, we can predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence, with pre-treatment fears and optimism predicting the development of fears of recurrence."}
{"answers": "Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL for experimental treatment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, symptoms matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials, with older adults with more symptoms having a higher risk of adverse events and poorer prognosis."}
{"answers": "Effective CPAP treatment in IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.", "prediction_text": "Yes, CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can offer a better quality of life and sleep. The study found that CPAP therapy significantly improved sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with OSA, including Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)."}
{"answers": "Income support policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader range of social and economic policies affect health.", "prediction_text": "No, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program does not reduce disability in the elderly. The study found that the maximum SSI benefit increased the rate of mobility limitations among single elderly individuals, but did not significantly affect the rate of mobility limitations among those aged sixty-five and older."}
{"answers": "None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that certain clinical identifiers, such as global loss of passive range of movement, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements, are associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR) in patients with early-stage adhesive capsulitis."}
{"answers": "Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications.", "prediction_text": "Yes, concerns remain regarding the use of cough and cold medicines in young children after the FDA warnings."}

{"answers": "ACS is common in patients with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a febrile patient with SCD.", "prediction_text": "No, the clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease is not accurate enough, as it does not improve significantly with increasing levels of pediatric training."}
{"answers": "We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with that achieved by consultants.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the quality of TME surgery between colorectal trainees and consultants."}
{"answers": "Dutch primary schools could play a more important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour if both the school and the parents support the policy.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the school food policy at Dutch primary schools is not as effective as it could be, with a significant proportion of principals and teachers believing that the policy is not clear and that parents are primarily responsible for encouraging healthy eating habits among children."}
{"answers": "Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.", "prediction_text": "No, motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality. The study found that schizophrenia patients had normal eye-tracking performance, and that the frequency of eye-tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance."}
{"answers": "(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant relationship between complex fractionated atrial electrograms recorded during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm fractionation."}
{"answers": "Continence function remained undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection", "prediction_text": "No, anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer."}
{"answers": "No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly dependent on canal space.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant correlation between ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical cord injury."}
{"answers": "Circumferences and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these anthropometric measures and indexes.", "prediction_text": "Yes, adult body circumferences are associated with height, with higher circumferences associated with higher heights."}

{"answers": "Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.", "prediction_text": "Yes, routine laboratory markers such as high-grade fibrosis, AST/ALT ratio, and MCV are useful in differentiating nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH)."}
{"answers": "We found no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although there was a significant incidence of implant infection.", "prediction_text": "No, immediate breast reconstruction does not compromise the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. The study found that IBR was associated with a lower complication rate and a shorter time to chemotherapy, but there was no significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy between the two groups."}
{"answers": "Economic inequalities in breast and cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high income inequality.", "prediction_text": "No, the inverse equity hypothesis does not apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries."}
{"answers": "Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on the basis of as required had a limited value.", "prediction_text": "No, antibiotics do not decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity."}
{"answers": "The study findings suggest that adopting measurement-based care, such as using the PHQ-9, is achievable, even in practices with limited resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring (PHQ-9) is helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry, with a high degree of influence on clinical decision making."}

{"answers": "The homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.", "prediction_text": "No, the context does not matter for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. The study found that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models, regardless of the region in which the data were collected."}
{"answers": "This study adds to the growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist as an important factor in the change process.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the variability in evidence-based treatments (EBTs) in practice is due to the variability in the training and supervision of therapists, with approximately 12% of the variability in outcome due to therapists."}
{"answers": "New depression diagnosis and antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location, with some groups showing a different effect depending on the ethnic group."}
{"answers": "These findings suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing fall risk in PD.", "prediction_text": "Yes, knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease. Specifically, knee extensor strength positively correlates with dynamic postural stability and negatively correlates with disease severity, while dynamic postural stability is negatively correlated with disease severity and positively correlated with functional ambulation."}
{"answers": "It is concluded that preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning without other complications.", "prediction_text": "No, preloading with colloids does not prevent hemodynamic changes when neurosurgical patients are subsequently changed to the seated position."}
{"answers": "Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no significant difference in the response to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in ischemic stroke between men and women."}

{"answers": "This study confirms that physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of \"significant\" LUTS and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine clinical assessment.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment, with physicians underestimating the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) on social limitations and emotions, and overestimating the impact of LUTS on social limitations and emotions."}
{"answers": "Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.", "prediction_text": "Yes, accompanying metabolic syndrome (MetS) contributes to heart dimensions in hypertensive patients, as evidenced by increased interventricular septal thickness, posterior wall thickness, and left atrial diameter, and a correlation between MetS and left atrial diameter."}
{"answers": "A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can be predicted at disease onset, with elevated plasma viscosity and starting treatment at a higher prednisolone dose being independently associated with a reduced probability of stopping steroids within a given time interval between 27 and 51%."}
{"answers": "The study suggests that there is no difference in clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.", "prediction_text": "No, surgical resection is not required in the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus. The study found that the addition of surgery to chemoradiotherapy did not improve overall survival, disease-free survival, or clinical toxicities."}

{"answers": "Skewed X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is associated with increasing maternal age.", "prediction_text": "No, there is no association between skewed X-inactivation and recurrent spontaneous abortion in a large, well-defined sample of women with recurrent loss."}
{"answers": "Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.", "prediction_text": "No, receipt of hospice care in nursing homes does not improve the management of pain at the end of life."}
{"answers": "The continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that residents in an academic vascular department are able to provide complete surgical care for patients, with a higher rate of preoperative assessment, involvement in the decision to operate, and postoperative assessment on the ward, compared to those who are not."}
{"answers": "Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.", "prediction_text": "No, oophorectomy is not necessary in children with ovarian torsion. The study found that detorsion alone can be effective in treating ovarian torsion in children, with a lower rate of postoperative complications and shorter length of stay compared to oophorectomy."}
{"answers": "Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.", "prediction_text": "No, half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is not sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis, as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the abdominal aorta and the common and external iliac arteries were not statistically significantly different between the 0.5 mL/second and 1 mL/second groups."}
{"answers": "There was no evidence of a trend in unsafe sex behaviour over time.

The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival of patients with CHF.", "prediction_text": "Yes, specialty care is associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The study found that patients who received cardiology clinic visits only (CARD-only) had a lower mortality rate compared to those who received general medicine clinic visits only (GM-only) and those who received both general medicine and cardiology (MIXED) clinic visits. Additionally, the MIXED group had a lower mortality rate compared to the no-GM/CARD group. These findings suggest that specialty care may be associated with improved survival of patients with CHF."}
{"answers": "Comparison of mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and for different components of body composition now require study.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an intrauterine influence on obesity, as the association between maternal and paternal BMI and offspring BMI is similar for both parents."}
{"answers": "TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.", "prediction_text": "Yes, transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients is marginally acceptable, as it excludes a significant proportion of hearts suitable for transplantation."}
{"answers": "Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.", "prediction_text": "Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) can be a lethal outcome for children, preteens, and adolescents, with a prevalence of up to 20% in some studies."}
{"answers": "The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and therefore save financial resources.", "prediction_text": "Yes, STIR imaging can be omitted in the evaluation of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T."}
{"answers": "This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.", "prediction_text": "The study found that the extent of agreement between approved doctors (ADs) and medical referees (MRs) in assessing a seafarer's fitness is poor, with only 58% of cases classified as permanently unfit by the ADs and only 54% classified as fit with restrictions by the MRs."}

{"answers": "Location of death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care and related services, where necessary.", "prediction_text": "Yes, ethnicity appears to affect where people with cancer die, with a higher likelihood of dying in hospital and a lower likelihood of dying in home."}
{"answers": "Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with Lynch syndrome.", "prediction_text": "No, women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary do not have Lynch syndrome."}
{"answers": "CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital CMV infection.

The study found that students achieved significantly higher scores for the OSCE stations \"TM\", \"AM\", and \"OE\" as well as \"overall OSCE score\" in the SE track, while the station score for \"PE\" was significantly higher for students in the FE track. The study also found that most of the small effect sizes were reported in the post-assessment evaluation portion of the study."}
{"answers": "Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.", "prediction_text": "Yes, immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the anal canal can have important implications for the treatment of anal incontinence in women. The study found that estrogen receptors were present in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter of all females and in four of the seven males, and progesterone receptors were present in the perimuscular connective tissue of all females and in four of the seven males. These findings suggest that estrogen and progesterone receptors may play a role in the regulation of anal continence in women, and that immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors may be a useful tool for the diagnosis and treatment of anal incontinence in women."}
{"answers": "In women with bothersome MUI, concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less improvement in OAB symptoms.", "prediction_text": "No, concomitant anterior/apical repair during midurethral sling does not improve the overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence."}

Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension. The study found that patients with sublingual varices had a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to those without sublingual varices."}
{"answers": "Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of vehicular gap times.", "prediction_text": "Yes, normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians are accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions, with the exception of the hearing only condition."}
{"answers": "Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is present.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the scrotal approach can be a useful initial surgical approach for both palpable and impalpable undescended testes, with a high success rate in detecting and treating these testes."}

{"answers": "Brachytherapy with ruthenium applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is needed.", "prediction_text": "Yes, escalation of the apical dose in beta-radiation of posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques can change the treatment outcome, with a higher 5-year overall survival rate observed in patients treated with a higher dose of radiation."}
{"answers": "The addition of epinephrine to ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.", "prediction_text": "No, exogenous epinephrine is not necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest in animals."}
{"answers": "In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this\u00a0was likely due to their being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.", "prediction_text": "Yes, reviewers' scores are influenced by citations to their own work. The study found that 8.3% of manuscripts contained citations to reviewer's work, with a mean score of 2.8 and a standard deviation of 1.4. The review scores of noncited reviewers were also higher, with a mean score of 2.5 and a standard deviation of 1.2. The study found that the mean score in the 117 noncited reviewers of the 57 manuscripts that had both cited and noncited reviewers was 2.9, compared to 2.9 for the 68 noncited reviewers. The study also found that the number of citations to reviewer's work was a confounder, with an unadjusted OR of 1.6 for"}

We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, long-term, and controlled studies are required.", "prediction_text": "Yes, scintigraphy is a guideline method in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot. The study found that the most distal site of the region displaying perfusion during the perfusion and early blood flow phase was marked as the amputation level, and the amputation levels were determined by 3-phase bone scintigraphy, Doppler ultrasound, and inspection of the infection-free clear region during surgery."}
{"answers": "At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.", "prediction_text": "No, socioeconomic status does not matter in lung cancer patients, as there was no significant difference in quality of life scores between patients with lower socioeconomic status and those with higher socioeconomic status."}
{"answers": "General surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the number of directional instructions given by participants to their assistant during a simulated small bowel repair is related to their ratings of technical skill. Specifically, participants who gave more instructions were found to have lower ratings of decay in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills, and a higher number of instructions correlated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task."}
