GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require surgical intervention simply because they grow.", "prediction_text": "No, the growth rate of a gallbladder polyp does not predict a neoplastic polyp. The study found that the growth rate of gallbladder polyps was not related to the neoplastic nature of the polyp, but older age and large size were significantly associated with neoplastic polyps."}
{"answers": "These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a \"second hit\", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the \"first hit\"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also account for the age-related increase in AF development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the R14C mutation in the KCNE1 gene is associated with genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation."}

Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the K/DOQI guidelines are adequate for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients with ergocalciferol. The study found that patients with elevated baseline PTH levels (>30 ng/ml) had a higher risk of developing vitamin D deficiency compared to those with lower baseline levels (<30 ng/ml)."}
{"answers": "Baseline pain intensity does not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.", "prediction_text": "No, pain intensity does not predict a poor opioid response in cancer patients. The study found that pain intensity was not significantly associated with opioid response in cancer patients, and that patients with response 'b' and 'd' had higher values of OEImg."}
{"answers": "Maintaining viral load suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that treatment as prevention (TAP) in resource-limited settings is feasible, with a median duration of 14 years of therapy and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in 47.8% of cases."}
{"answers": "Mucosal redundancy is a constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the initiating factors in its development.", "prediction_text": "Yes, there is an etiologic role for pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The study found that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, with a ratio of 0.89 in the pyloric mucosa and a ratio of 0.89 in the surrounding hypertrophied muscle."}
{"answers": "Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore merit further consideration.", "prediction_text": "Yes, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is not a predictable outcome in newborns, as there is no significant association between false-negatives and true-negatives, false-positives, or false-negatives in the multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounding factors."}
{"answers": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.", "prediction_text": "Yes, global management at the same centre improves the results of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases compared to local management."}
{"answers": "epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.", "prediction_text": "Yes, a high correlation was found between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of pleomorphic adenomas and the histologic subtype of primary parotid gland tumors."}
{"answers": "The survey shows significant dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 27% if given improved training and support.

{"answers": "Our data have revealed a number of differences. Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that both Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms. The study found that the Web-based sample was younger, less likely to be in paid employment, and less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy, while the clinic sample was more likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile. Additionally, the study found that those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper psychological symptom tertiles, and those in the study"}
{"answers": "The majority of acetabular components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus.", "prediction_text": "Yes, the study found that the cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. The study found that the initial contact surface reached at surgery between the acetabular component and the pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) and that the contact surface was significantly higher than the initial contact surface reached at the time of surgery. Additionally, the contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component"}

{"answers": "After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.", "prediction_text": "Yes, magnetic resonance (MR) substitutes for diagnostic arthroscopy can be used for the detection and characterization of occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee. The study found that the MRI and arthroscopy were able to detect occult post-traumatic lesions of the knee in 52 cases, with a mean of 45 osteochondral injuries and a mean of 19 chondral injuries. The study also noted that the MRI and arthroscopy were able to detect occult post-t"}
