  "description": "PubMedQA is a novel biomedical question answering (QA) dataset collected from PubMed abstracts.\nThe task of PubMedQA is to answer research questions with yes/no/maybe (e.g.: Do preoperative\nstatins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?) using the corresponding abstracts.\nPubMedQA has 1k expert-annotated, 61.2k unlabeled and 211.3k artificially generated QA instances.\nEach PubMedQA instance is composed of (1) a question which is either an existing research article\ntitle or derived from one, (2) a context which is the corresponding abstract without its conclusion,\n(3) a long answer, which is the conclusion of the abstract and, presumably, answers the research question,\nand (4) a yes/no/maybe answer which summarizes the conclusion.\nPubMedQA is the first QA dataset where reasoning over biomedical research texts, especially their\nquantitative contents, is required to answer the questions.\n",
